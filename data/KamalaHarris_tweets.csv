Our nation’s founders often disagreed, but as they wrote our Constitution, they laid out the foundation of our democracy, including the rule of law, checks and balances, free and fair elections, and a peaceful transfer of power. These principles and traditions have sustained our nation for over two centuries. Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs have cherished, upheld, and defended them.

Those were my first memories of seeing people fighting for the freedoms and the promise of America that had long been kept from them.

As I have traveled across the country, I have spoken with many Americans—including Black men—about their hopes, dreams, hurdles, and worries. Black men and boys deserve a president who sees them, and will help break through the barriers preventing them from building intergenerational wealth and realizing their aspirations.

Donald Trump is not that president.

Trump’s business career began when he was investigated for refusing to rent property to Black families. His entry into public life was when he took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the execution of the Central Park Five—innocent Black teenagers who were later exonerated. As president, he called majority-Black nations “shitholes.”

Today, Trump’s Project 2025 agenda would give him unchecked power, posing an even more serious threat to Black communities. He would bring back stop-and-frisk, roll back civil and voting rights, and implement a national sales tax costing families an average of $4,000 per year.

We can’t go back—and we do not have to. Today, I’m announcing an Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.

It will, among other things, provide 1 million fully forgivable loans to entrepreneurs, and protect cryptocurrency investments so people who make them know their money is safe. It will launch a National Health Equity Initiative focused on illnesses that disproportionately impact Black men like sickle cell disease and diabetes. And it will legalize recreational marijuana and ensure that all Americans have opportunities to succeed as this new industry takes shape.

The January 6 Committee exemplified a bipartisan effort to safeguard our democracy and preserve our most sacred freedoms for generations to come—led by Republicans like @Liz_Cheney and @AdamKinzinger, who chose to put country over party—alongside Democrats. 

The oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States is sacred and must always be upheld—never violated. The most fundamental question in this election is: Who will obey that oath?

I have sworn that oath to uphold the Constitution six times throughout my career—not only as Vice President or as a U.S. Senator, but also as the top law enforcement officer of the largest state in our country. I have never wavered in upholding that oath, and I have always executed it faithfully and without reservation.

2024-09-29 14:14:02+00:00,"This week, I was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to discuss how we will strengthen our economy and chart a new way forward. There’s an old saying that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. That is the story of the Steel City. A city that helped build the middle class, birth America’s labor movement, and empower the rise of American manufacturing and innovation. 

We have an extraordinary opportunity at this moment. An opportunity to make our middle class the engine of America's prosperity; to build a stronger economy where everyone, everywhere, has a chance to pursue their dreams and aspirations; and for the United States of America to continue to out-innovate and out-compete the world. 

That is why I created our Opportunity Economy Agenda. It would increase the tax deduction for startups by ten times to $50,000—because no one can start a business on $5,000. We have set an ambitious goal of 25 million new small business applications by the end of the first term, and we will strengthen our small businesses owners and entrepreneurs, the backbone of America’s economy. 

We will also invest in the industries like the ones that made Pittsburgh the Steel City. We will offer tax credits to strengthen factory towns—retooling existing factories, hiring locally, and adding good union jobs—because no one who grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned. We will also invest in emerging technologies to make sure America, and not China, are at the forefront of innovation. 

The proud heritage of Pittsburgh reveals the character of our nation: A nation that harnesses the ambitions, dreams, and aspirations of our people—and seizes the opportunities before us. That is what we have always done. And that is what we must now do.",9228,2259,3520
