He said very clearly that, quoting again, the EU has to accept at least a million asylum seekers annually.

From Brexit to U.S. elections, George Soros has made a habit of throwing his billions into political causes that align with his agenda.

His Open Society Foundations bankroll everything from activist groups to media watchdogs, giving him a backdoor to influence policies worldwide.

In the U.S., Soros funds Media Matters for America, a progressive group targeting conservative media.

It doesn't stop there! Wikimedia, the company that owns Wikipedia, received at least three grants from Soros' Foundation—one of them for $330,000.

It also granted over $350,000 to the pro-DEI, anti-Brexit European Movement UK.

Soros calls it ""promoting democracy,"" but funding campaigns, media, and political organizations feels more like interference.

Through the Open Society Foundations, Soros has given 19,743 grants.

Is it time for Soros to stay out of politics? Will the media attack Soros the way they attack Elon?

We know they won’t.

Real-world video driving data is far superior. Tesla has 7.1 million vehicles on the road worldwide, collectively driving upwards 75 billion miles annually. Each vehicle is equipped with multiple cameras, adding up to a total of more than 56 million cameras that Tesla is capable of actively capturing real-world video driving data from. Billions of miles are now driven on FSD every year, and growing.

Synthetic driving data is kinda like using ChatGPT, you might trust what you see is true, but you often can't be entirely certain without further validation.

They were debanked, deplatformed. They were put on a terror watch list. Permanently. Every single time they fly they get flagged and made a spectacle out of  every airport.

A disturbing pattern emerges from Farage's revelations: Labour suppresses inquiries while Conservatives dodge responsibility. 

For 14 years, the Tories had power to investigate rape gangs targeting children. 

They didn't. 

Now Starmer, who was Director of Public Prosecutions during the crisis, blocks a statutory inquiry.

This isn't incompetence - it's institutional cowardice.

When political correctness trumps protecting children, the system isn't just broken - it's corrupt.

While authorities sanitize terminology (""grooming gangs"" instead of ""rape gangs""), predators operate with impunity across 50 British cities.

In the United States, a Nonprofit financed by George Soros pumped $140M into nonprofits pushing voter laws and abortion initiatives, plus $23.9M to progressive “dark money” groups like Sixteen Thirty Fund.

In Brazil, he funneled $32M to 118 groups, backing prison reform, disarmament, and drug decriminalization. Major recipients include Conectas and Instituto Sou da Paz.

In the UK, Soros gave £400K to Best for Britain to stop Brexit and pledged more to pro-EU causes.

1. Starmer doesn't seem to know why Tommy Robinson is in jail. He seems to be referring to a previous conviction from 6 years ago in Huddersfield, which in itself was certainly a politically  motivated reason to put Tommy behind bars then. This happens so often it's easy to get them mixed up. 

2. Starmer dismisses these valid critiques as merely the ""playbook"" of the ""far right"". He did the same thing after the fear and frustration boiled over after the Southport Massacre, where a Muslim radical stabbed 8 children, killing 3.  He has no sympathy whatsover for the English working class, and stigmatises them with the ""far right"" label as outside of the bounds of his consideration. 

3. Starmer plays the victim for both himself and Jess Phillips. Instead of accepting that he and his government have done wrong here, he instead claims that ""threats"" have been sent and this means he doesn't have to tolerate any criticism of his handling of the rape gangs. 

4. Starmer finishes by saying that the government will ""will get on with the job of protecting victims, including child sexual abuse, mandatory reporting, accelerating the process"", but this would not have been necessary if it wasn't for their own attempt to cover up the story and dismiss the victims in the first place, which is essentially an admission that Elon and Tommy are right, and if they hadn't kicked up a fuss about this, nothing would have changed. 

The entire way Starmer has handled this is disgraceful, in my view. He is acting as if preventing the rape of children, and bringing justice to those victims of rape gangs, is somehow a partisan issue that only the ""far right"" would be concerned about and that this is a ""bandwagon"", and not a legitimate crime that has happened against the British people.

With four of his Pakistani friends, they stole a car and roamed the streets of Glasgow with a bag of torture instruments looking for White boys to target.

They targeted 19-year-old Jamie Wallace, who managed to escape, and his friend Kriss, who had the day off school because he wasn't feeling well. 

The Pakistanis proceeded to take Kriss, who they called a ""white bastard"", to a remote location and torture him for hours -- gouging his eyes out, castrating him, burning him with cigarettes, stabbing him repeatedly, dousing him in gasoline and setting him alight before he crawled to his death.

If there had been social media, I think it would have been impossible to hide, if there'd been freedom of speech as well.

It's worth noting that the First Amendment in the United States was freedom of speech because the people that came to the United States from other countries did not have freedom of speech.

If they had said something, they could be imprisoned or killed.

The scandal is already reshaping British politics. It’s not just about the heinous nature of the crimes. It’s that every level of the British system is implicated in the cover-up.

Social workers were intimidated into silence. Local police ignored, excused, and even abetted pedophile rapists across dozens of cities. Senior police and Home Office officials deliberately avoided action in the name of maintaining what they called “community relations.” Local councilors and Members of Parliament rejected pleas for help from the parents of raped children. Charities, NGOs, and Labour MPs accused those who discussed the scandal of racism and Islamophobia. The media mostly ignored or downplayed the biggest story of their lifetimes. Zealous in their incuriosity, much of Britain’s media elite remained barnacled to the bubble of Westminster politics and its self-serving priorities.

They did this to defend a failed model of multiculturalism, and to avoid asking hard questions about failures of immigration policy and assimilation. They did this because they were afraid of being called racist or Islamophobic. They did this because Britain’s traditional class snobbery had fused with the new snobbery of political correctness.

All of which is why no one knows precisely how many thousands of young girls were raped in how many towns across Britain since the 1970s.""",82929,21910,3977

2025-01-06 08:36:29+00:00,"🚨🇬🇧LABOUR BLOCKS CHILD RAPE GANG INQUIRY TO HIDE ITS SHAMEFUL PAST

Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips' refusal for a public inquiry into child rape gangs shows Labour is desperate to bury its complicity in years of horrific abuse. 

Survivors demanded justice for crimes ignored by authorities, but Phillips continues to insist that a local review is enough - a move critics see as a blatant cover-up.

Labour has a dark history of turning a blind eye to grooming scandals. 

From Rotherham to Rochdale to Telford, Labour-run councils and police forces ignored or suppressed abuse allegations to avoid upsetting “community cohesion.” 

Vulnerable girls paid the price, enduring unspeakable horrors while Labour politicians prioritized their reputation and voter base.

In Rotherham, victims were doused in petrol, brutally raped, and silenced with threats, while Labour councilors silenced whistleblowers and downplayed abuse to avoid being labeled “racist.”

In Telford, over 1,000 girls were abused, with police and councils turning a blind eye to avoid accusations of racism.

In Oldham, as in other towns, Labour leaders failed to act on abuse warnings, fearing backlash from their “multicultural” voter base.

By blocking a full inquiry, Labour isn't just avoiding accountability - it’s abandoning survivors all over again. 

If they have nothing to hide, why are they so terrified of the truth?

To put it another way, “racism” got 82 times the attention. Apparently, the media had other priorities.

 Even “white privilege,” not exactly dinner-table chatter, managed 6,146 mentions, outpacing the grooming scandal. 

“Black Lives Matter” clocked in at 59,338, and “far right” soared with 141,367 mentions—because nothing grabs headlines like a scary buzzword. 

Meanwhile, the grooming gang crisis barely registered on the radar.

The establishment has done everything in its power to silence Robinson, from abusing terror legislation to throwing him into solitary confinement. All because he dared to expose truths that others were too afraid to touch. As Habib rightly pointed out, this isn’t about justice—it’s about silencing a man who’s become an inconvenient thorn in the side of those in power.  

Robinson’s plight is a reflection of the broader failure of our institutions. He represents the working-class citizens who feel betrayed and ignored, the people who have been screaming for justice while the media and political elites look the other way.  

For years, Robinson has faced persecution, yet his message resonates with thousands who see through the lies and cover-ups. As Habib stated, “When the establishment fears someone, they don’t debate them—they destroy them.”  

It’s time to stop pretending. Tommy Robinson is not just a political prisoner—he’s a symbol of the fight for free speech and accountability.

2025-01-05 21:35:37+00:00,"Today, a number of prominent journalists criticised my suggestion that the UK media class has failed to sufficiently cover the rape gangs scandal, which will go down as one of the biggest scandals in our history

So, I decided to take a closer look at the data. 

Trust me, you'll want to read until the end

First, the boring bit. How did I do it?

I used something called Lexis, a database researchers use to search content across UK newspapers

Every good researcher out there knows how to use it so they can duplicate my work and check

One of my critics today said my use of ""grooming gangs"" in my initial numbers was misleading because much of the coverage in UK newspapers uses ""grooming gang"" not ""gangS"".

OK then, let's use that

And let's just look at articles that are specifically about this scandal and don't just mention it in passing

What did I find?

Let's look at the years 2011-2025 because before that, even though the rape gangs scandal goes back decades, there was NOTHING in UK media.

Nothing.

They didn't touch it AT ALL --despite widespread rumours pushed by groups like the BNP and EDL

2011 is a crucial year because it's when renegade and HERO Andrew Norfolk, at The Times, started to write the first early pieces, despite abuse & harassment

First, let's look at ALL UK newspapers

In 2011-2025 there were 4,659 articles specifically focused on the ""grooming gang"" phenomenon

Wow

Sounds a lot right?

Remember the number. 

""Grooming gang"" = 4,659

But now let's compare that with how much coverage the media class gave to other scandals and terms

""white privilege"" = 6,146

""anti-Muslim"" = 17,152

""post office"" and ""horizon"" =20,274

""extreme right"" = 21,252

""Islamophobia"" = 23,461

""Greta Thunberg"" = 22,717

""expenses scandal"" =25,585

""Stephen Lawrence"" = 29,808

""anti-racism"" = 34,484

""Windrush"" = 35,515

""George Floyd"" = 38,824

""Black Lives Matter"" = 59,338

""Grenfell"" = 71,422

""Britain"" and ""racism"" = 75,693

""Net Zero"" = 141,367

""far right"" = 231,540

""racism"" = 382,069

I could go on. 

I think the numbers speak for themselves. 

Relative to other scandals and amid a strong liberal bias in parts of the media class, the mass rape of young, working-class white girls & women just wasn't a priority

Yes, there were newspapers that broke the story and pushed it, like the Times in 2011 

But even there, the 440 articles built around ""grooming gang"" between 2011-2025 is dwarfed by, say, the 2,868 on ""Islamophobia"", the 3,202 on Stephen Lawrence, the 2,603 on George Floyd, or the 5,524 on BLM

My point is not to bash individual newspapers but to say that relative to other race-related stories and debates, the rape gangs scandal --ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST SCANDAL IN OUR HISTORY-- has received very little coverage from the media class 

I'd give you the numbers for liberal progressive papers like The Guardian/Observer but frankly they're absurd

Oh ok then

Between 2011 and 2025 the Guardian had 113 articles on the grooming gang phenomenon compared to 3,325 for ""Islamophobia""

What about the BBC? 

We can look at BBC News 24 and BBC Radio 4

There were 357 specific mentions of the ""grooming gang"" scandal in BBC News/Radio 4 transcripts

Meanwhile, there were 7,537 for ""George Floyd"", 3,219 for ""Stephen Lawrence"", 7,416 for ""Black Lives Matter"", and 2,259 for ""Islamophobia""

You get the picture. I won't keep going

But what I will say is this.

These girls were never a priority in Media Land

Relative to other scandals they were at first ignored and then downplayed

Too many of the middle-class, Oxbridge-educated, socially liberal if not radically woke progressive elites who control the parameters of what they think is our national ""debate"" routinely steer clear of scandals and issues that violate tightly-controlled taboos around immigration, multiculturalism, ""diversity"" in all its forms, and which are backed up with alarmist narratives about the ""far right"" and ""Islamophobia"" to warn others off from asking difficult questions or challenging the elite consensus in Westminster and London

This HAS to change

As I wrote in my Substack this morning, @elonmusk has done Britain a favour by forcing us to reckon with a truly NATIONAL scandal that has for too long been ignored and pushed to the side by political, media, and cultural elites in wider society

This past week, we have been pushed into a new era in which millions of people up and down this country are either learning about the rape gangs crisis for the first time or hearing shocking new details they did not know before and can scarcely believe

And millions of people are now asking some enormous questions. How did our country let this happen to our children? Why was it overlooked? Why did so many people stay silent? Is it still happening today? What can we do to stop it? Who is pursuing the truth in media? Who is naming and shaming? And why does the UK media class fall over itself when a single American man dies in Minneapolis while seemingly not giving a shit about the thousands of CHILDREN who have been abused, raped and harassed here in Britain?

The people have tuned into this scandal, in other words. They have taken notice and they are watching. The only question now is whether the media class has bothered to notice and will actually get on top of this scandal and push it to front of the agenda or continue to ask ridiculous questions like it did for much of today, deflecting from its glaring failures to instead obsess about Elon Musk. 

Find the truth and tell us the truth.

That's your job.",25540,8700,1309

2025-01-05 19:31:47+00:00,"🇬🇧 STARMER’S ISLAMOPHOBIA PLAN BLASTED AS “A GIFT TO GROOMING GANGS”

Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick claims a “false label” of Islamophobia hindered investigations into grooming gangs involving British-Pakistani men.

“For decades, the rule of law was abandoned to sustain the myth that ‘diversity is our strength.'""

Jenrick warns that a formal Islamophobia definition could stifle free speech and block efforts to address criminality in specific communities.

Critics warn Starmer’s plan is a chilling blow to free speech and a disaster for accountability.

Labour’s proposal follows past criticism of the APPG’s 2018 definition, which some say risks undermining public discourse and historical truth.

2025-01-03 16:55:30+00:00,"I feel like many people still don’t quite understand the level of depravity inflicted on those little girls — or just how young they were.

Think of your sister, daughter, or granddaughter as a child. Picture them. Think of how young and vulnerable they were.

Lucy Lowe was 14.
Vicky Round was 12.
Becky Watson was 11.
Charlene Downes was 11 or 12.
Sammy Woodhouse was 14.
Victoria Agoglia was 13.
Sarah Wilson was 11.
And there are countless more.

They were children. Many barely out of primary school, so young and in no way responsible for the atrocities committed against them. 

Think about what gangs of Pakistani-Muslim men put those little girls through. Now imagine it was your sister, daughter or granddaughter.

Pakistani-Muslim grooming gangs plied them with alcohol and drugs, they raped them in graveyards, they put them into the back of taxis and drove them to be gang-raped by 20+ of their friends, they dismembered them and sold them as kebab meat, they inserted a pump into their anal cavity and had multiple men sodomise them at once, they raped them on filthy mattresses above takeaway shops, they forced panties down their throat to muffle the screams, they threatened to murder them if they told anyone, they brutally beat them, they killed them and torched their houses with their family inside, they picked them up from local authority care homes to be raped, they forced them to take crack cocaine and heroin, they convinced them they loved them so they could abuse them, they killed their unborn children, they targeted the most vulnerable and marginalised, they told them no one would believe them, they forced them to get abortions, they passed them round like a piece of meat, they threatened to kill their families, they gaslit and manipulated them.

And that is just a fraction of the abuse inflicted by Pakistani-Muslim grooming gangs in Telford, Rochdale, Rotherham, Oldham and elsewhere. That is just a tiny percentage of the horror that thousands of little girls faced at the hands of their abusers.

Now think about the people that were meant to protect them. Who comes to mind? Police, local councils, social services, sexual health clinics, schools, care homes.

But they didn’t.

Those in positions of power turned a blind eye for decades while little girls were being raped, tortured, and murdered.

They branded them “white slags”, “child prostitutes”, and “paki shaggers”. They walked in on victims naked and drugged with 20+ adult men and only arrested the child, they arrested girls for prostitution and handed them back to the same men that were exploiting them, they added the victims to dockets as co-defendants in their own abuse, they downplayed the scale of abuse, they refused to investigate reports, they paid for the taxi rides the girls got raped during, they silenced whistleblowers (like @MaggieOliverUK), they blamed the girls for their own abuse, they tried to block inquiries, and more.

Imagine all of this happened to your sister. Or your daughter. Or your granddaughter.

Now think again about how young they were, how vulnerable, how innocent.

Every single Republican and 51 Democrats voted in favor. Shockingly, 158 Democrats opposed it.

The bill targeted rapists, pedophiles, domestic abusers, and stalkers, ensuring they couldn’t stay in the U.S. 

Opponents claimed it ""demonized immigrants,"" but how does protecting convicted predators help anyone—especially their victims?

Deporting violent offenders isn’t “fearmongering”—it’s basic public safety. 

Why would anyone vote to keep criminals who prey on women and children?

This appalling affair is the final nail in the coffin for liberals who still cling to the argument that Britain is an integration success story.

The scandal started with the onset of mass migration. Importing hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures, who possess medieval attitudes towards women, brought us here. And after 30 years of this disastrous experiment, we now have entrenched sectarian voting blocs that make it electoral suicide for some MPs to confront this. This scandal shows why we must end it.

Labour’s deliberate policy of opening the UK to mass immigration added over 3 million people to the population, while nearly 1 million British citizens left, citing a country they no longer recognized. This wasn’t an accident—it was a calculated political strategy to reshape Britain and “rub the Right’s nose in diversity,” as former Labour insider Andrew Neather revealed.

The impact? Strained public services, fractured communities, and an erosion of trust in government.

For decades, Labour ignored overwhelming public opposition, prioritizing political gain over societal stability. Working-class voters were abandoned, their concerns dismissed as “covert racism.”

This wasn’t just mismanagement—it was willful neglect. Even employers and the middle classes turned a blind eye, benefiting from cheap labor and conveniences at the expense of poorer neighborhoods. Meanwhile, institutions like the BBC stifled debate, branding critics as racists and failing their duty of impartiality.

Today, as Britain faces the consequences of these decisions, the need for immigration reform has never been clearer. Controlled, limited migration is essential, but mass immigration without foresight or public consent must never happen again.

Former Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk has revealed that Labour figures, including ex-party chairman Tony Lloyd, pressured him not to link rape gangs to the Asian Muslim community, fearing it would harm their electoral prospects.

This disgraceful political cowardice ignored the horrific abuse of vulnerable children, with estimates suggesting up to a million young girls have suffered at the hands of rape gangs across the UK. Danczuk described being “threatened” by Lloyd to stay silent and accused Labour of sacrificing justice for the sake of votes.

Tory’s Kemi Badenoch call for a national inquiry into grooming gangs highlights the urgent need to uncover the truth and hold enablers accountable. Yet, Labour’s refusal to support investigations in places like Oldham and Bradford demonstrates a shocking disregard for victims.

Will they commit to deporting ALL foreign nationals involved? Including family members who were aware of the crimes, and therefore complicit.

Will they commit to stripping citizenship from dual nationals implicated, and deport them too?

Will they undertake a full investigation into officials who had knowledge of these crimes, yet failed to act? Even worse, proactively covering it up?

How many girls do they estimate have been affected?

What is the Home Office currently doing in order to prevent ongoing grooming, rape, exploitation or abuse of young British girls? How many girls are estimated to still be involved with these gangs?

Will they publish a full nationality breakdown of those convicted for such offences, along with the location of their crimes?

Will they publish a breakdown of the immigration status of those involved? On what grounds were they in the UK? Do they have previous convictions? How many foreign nationals found guilty have been released, but not deported? How many reoffences have occurred?

How many children have been born following a rape from these men? How many have been given access to the child, against the mother's wishes? How many have used the child as a route to remain in the UK? Will the Home Office commit to preventing this in the future?

Will the Home Secretary officially apologise to all those affected for the state's failure to act? And look to provide a comprehensive compensation scheme.

Will life-long sentences now be considered? For those British citizens involved in the crimes, but also those in positions of power who acted to cover up the scale of the abuse.

In a lot of cases, it is the average citizen that knows more than the journalist.

Very often, when I see an article about something that I know a lot about, and I read the article, they get a lot wrong.

It's the best interpretation of someone who doesn't really understand what's going on in the industry, has only a few facts to play with, and has to come up with an article. 

It's not going to hit the bullseye.

If you read an article about something you know about, how accurate is that article?

Now, imagine that that is how essentially all articles are.

They're an approximation of what's going on, but not an exact situation.

If somebody is actually an expert in the field, and was actually there and then writes about their experience of being actually there, I think that actually that's, in a lot of cases, going to be better than a journalist because the journalist wasn't there.”

___________________________

Some of you know that I’m a white guy married to a black woman for over 30 years.

My wife’s family on both sides traces its heritage back to slave days, and all of her family grew up in the Deep South.  Through the years, I have been privileged to hear stories from her parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles about what it was like to be black in America under Jim Crow.  I don’t think one can fully appreciate the horrors and evils of that system unless you hear it explained stoically and matter-of-factly by one of its victims.  The stories were appalling.  Through all of those stories though, the common theme that always struck me was the indignity of it all.  As a black American in those days, you had to “know your place.”  If you suffered discrimination silently, nothing worse could happen to you.  But if you spoke up—if you were “uppity”—the consequences could be dire economically, socially and even fatally via lynchings.  So if you loved your family, you kept your mouth shut, willingly remained subservient in the face of active discrimination, and suffered the INDIGNITY of it all.  

That indignity of silent suffering was corrosive to the soul, which I think is one of the most pernicious and unspoken psychological effects on each victim who lived through that era.

""Corrosive to the soul.”  Hold that thought.

Fast forward to last week, where I was forced to endure my firm’s annual DEI training.  I had to sit there silently while I was informed that I had earned none of the things that I earned through my own blood, sweat and tears; that I was inherently and unchangeably inferior because of the color of my skin and my genitalia; that all that I owned and am were only there due to “privilege” and the “patriarchy”; and that if I spoke out against any of this, it only proved my racism and my ignorance as to my own privilege.  

That’s when it occurred to me.  I was supposed to just sit there silently and “know my place.”  This was an INDIGNITY.  I knew it, they knew it, and if I were to speak up—if I were to be “uppity”—a real potential existed that significant economic and social harm would come crashing down on me.  So because I love my family, I kept my mouth shut.  I sat silently and steamed.  My soul corroded a little bit that day.

Now I know this analogy is far from perfect.  The forms of discrimination black Americans faced under Jim Crow were far, far worse than what I might ever face in terms of lost income or social/professional opportunities as a result of DEI, and the penalties I might face for speaking out publicly against DEI pale in comparison to the extreme risks of false imprisonment or lynching death that tangibly existed under Jim Crow.

Still, I sensed a common psychology of both systems.

I was the victim of active discrimination based on my race and gender.  I had to suffer this indignity in silence.  This was corrosive to my soul.  I was living a familiar refrain.

DEI is Jim Crow in a new, less aggressive, deceptively benign form.  But both Jim Crow and DEI have corroded the souls of their victims, and they both have served to corrode the collective soul of the United States of America.

If we are ever to live up to our founding promises, DEI must be crushed and eliminated as the soul-corroding cancer that it is, just as we crushed and eliminated Jim Crow.",14982,3386,1616

There was never any evidence that right-wing political violence was increasing

by @shellenberger 
FBI Director Christopher Wray; New Orleans terrorism suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar; President Joe Biden

A 42-year-old former Army IT specialist named Shamsud-Din Jabbar committed an act of terrorism by killing 15 in his truck in New Orleans early on New Year’s Day, says the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). And there appears to be abundant evidence, including testimony from his close relatives and videos he posted to Facebook, that radical Islamic ideology motivated Jabbar.

Jabbar’s motivations may come as a surprise to millions of Americans. After all, for the last four years, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), President Joe Biden, and other United States agencies that constitute the Intelligence Community (IC) have emphasized that the greatest threat of terrorism comes from white supremacists, not radicalized Islamists.

The “top threat we face from DVEs [Domestic Violent Extremist] continues to be those we identify as Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists (‘RMVEs’), specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race,” FBI Director Christopher Wray told Senate Judiciary Committee on March 2, 2021.

“According to the intelligence community,” said Biden in 2021, “terrorism from white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeland today. Not ISIS, not al Qaeda — white supremacists.”

As a result, Wray said in 2021 that "" racially motivated violent extremism is the biggest chunk of our domestic terrorism portfolio, if you will, overall. I will also say that the same group of people we're talking about have been responsible for the most lethal attacks over the last decade.""

Those arguments have continued over the last four years. In August 2024, the New Yorker reported “around 2018 the F.B.I. began seeing an increase in racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists—in particular, ‘individuals espousing the superiority of the white race.’”

The evidence never supported any of those claims.
Between 2012 and 2021, Islamic extremists committed five acts of domestic US terrorism that killed 77 people, whereas white supremacists committed four acts of domestic terrorism that killed 49 people. And even if the numbers were reversed, at just 12 cases of domestic terrorism, the sample size is too small to be able to claim, scientifically, any kind of discernible trend about DVE.

The total number of killings by white supremacists annually is very low. In 2022, there were only 21 homicides linked to white supremacists in the entire country. By comparison, Chicago alone saw an average of 58 homicides every month. In 2022, there were a total of 24,849 homicides. Thus, the share of them that were by white supremacists was .08%.

This is not to suggest that the FBI could have prevented the New Orleans attack on New Year’s had it been more focused on the threat of would-be Islamic terrorists. The FBI was still on the alert for Islamic terrorism, even as it claimed that white supremacists posed a greater threat. And some mass killings are difficult to prevent so long as we live in a relatively free society.

But the fact that some mass killings may be difficult to prevent is no excuse for the FBI to mislead the public, policymakers, and other law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The FBI’s claim that white supremacy was the main driver of the acts of terrorism was also misleading. Most of the white supremacist killers appeared to suffer from mental illness, whereas most of the radical Islamicists appeared sane and driven overwhelmingly by ideology. The Wisconsin shooter had a history of alcoholism and depression; the Charleston and Pittsburgh shooters showed signs of paranoia; the El Paso shooter was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a chronic and serious mental illness that combines the symptoms of schizophrenia, including hallucinations or delusions, with a mood disorder like depression or bipolar disorder; and the Buffalo shooter had been temporarily committed to a mental hospital. The only exceptionto this appears to be the Orlando shooter.

Thus, there was never any good evidence that there was a rising threat of terrorism from the political ideology of white supremacy, nor that it was greater than the threat of Islamist terrorism. And yet FBI Director Wray, President Biden, and the whole of the US IC have claimed, repeatedly, for four years, that it was. Why?

""Hi Grok!

If you fire a weapon inside a Tesla Cybertruck, from what distance outside of the truck can the gunshot be heard?""

""The audibility of a gunshot from inside a Tesla Cybertruck largely depends on several factors including the type of weapon fired, the surrounding environment, and the structural integrity of the Cybertruck itself. Here's what we can infer from the available information:

Vehicle Design: The Tesla Cybertruck is made with ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel, which is intended to provide durability, including some level of bullet resistance. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it's soundproof. The design might affect how sound travels out of the vehicle due to the materials used and the shape of the truck.

Sound Propagation: Sound from a gunshot inside the Cybertruck would propagate through the vehicle's structure and open air. The stainless steel body might dampen some sound, but not entirely, especially if windows or doors are open or if the sound can escape through other structural paths like vents or seams. 
Environmental Factors: The environment outside the truck plays a significant role. In an open field, sound might travel further than in an urban area with buildings that can block or absorb sound. Weather conditions, like wind direction and ambient noise levels, also influence how far a gunshot can be heard.
Weapon Type: The caliber and type of weapon would impact the loudness of the gunshot. A 9mm handgun, for instance, might produce a less loud sound compared to a higher-caliber rifle or shotgun, which would be louder regardless of the vehicle's material. However, specific tests on the Cybertruck with different weapons (like Tommy Guns, handguns, and rifles) have shown varying levels of penetration but not necessarily soundproofing.

Given these considerations:

Distance of Audibility: Without specific soundproofing tests on the Cybertruck, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact distance. However, as a general guideline, gunshots from handguns can typically be heard up to about 1-2 miles under optimal conditions. For rifles, this can extend to several miles. Inside a vehicle like the Cybertruck, the sound might be slightly muffled but still audible at significant distances, potentially reduced to several hundred yards to half a mile if considering typical suburban environments with some background noise.
Testing Data: There isn't direct data from tests specifically measuring sound propagation from gunshots inside a Cybertruck, but the bullet resistance tests imply that while the truck can handle some gunfire in terms of physical damage, sound would still escape.

Therefore, while the Cybertruck might slightly dampen the sound of a gunshot, it's reasonable to expect that in most scenarios, the gunshot would be audible from several hundred yards to over a mile, depending on the above factors. However, for precise measurements, controlled testing would be necessary.""",1400,197,233

“one person dead and seven injured: this is the toll of the explosion that occurred at 8:40 in the morning in las vegas, nevada, when a tesla cybertruck exploded and then caught fire, killing the driver and injuring seven people nearby, in the parking area of a luxury hotel owned by donald trump. the injured were admitted to three hospitals, while firefighters had to work for hours to extract a body from the wreckage of the electric suv. the cause of the incident is not yet clear.”

he believed it. as any normal person might, if they didn’t know they lived in a propaganda state.

but on X, we knew within minutes what actually happened. videos, eyewitness accounts, and experts flooded the platform. 
it wasn’t the cybertruck that exploded, it was a terror attack.

while X users called BS right away, mainstream outlets doubled down on the lie, implying the car was to blame. italian state-owned media, even 12 hours later, was still spinning it, hinting that the cybertruck “exploded on its own.”

this is the power of decentralized, citizen-led media. 
X is the antidote to the propaganda machine. we’re lucky it exists, lucky that regular people can counter the lies in real time.

but the scariest part? realizing how distorted reality must look to people who don’t use X. people like my brother, who hasn’t grown up terminally online like i have, trust the news like a normal person would.

THE RAPE OF BRITAIN - EPISODE 1

Nicole's story.

Nicole was raped and pimped at the age of 11 by members of a grooming gang in Telford, one of many, many cases in that area.

A man is languishing in solitary confinement in a high security prison because he dared to speak out and tell the truth about this scourge - the industrialised rape, pimping, and molestation of little girls by depraved adult men.

That man is Tommy Robinson.

Only the AfD Can Save Germany

Germany stands at a critical juncture, its future teetering on the edge of economic and cultural collapse. As someone who has invested significantly in Germany's industrial and technological landscape, I believe I have earned the right to speak candidly about its political direction. 

The Alternative for Germany (AfD) represents the last vestige of hope for this nation. Here's why: 

Economic Revival:

Germany's economy, once the powerhouse of Europe, is now mired in bureaucracy and stifling regulations. The AfD understands that economic freedom is not just desirable but necessary. Their approach to reducing government overreach, cutting taxes, and deregulating the market echoes the principles that have made Tesla and SpaceX successful. If Germany is to reclaim its industrial might, it needs a party that will not just talk about growth but enact policies to foster an environment where businesses can thrive without the heavy hand of government. 

 Immigration and National Identity:

Germany has opened its borders to mass migration, which, while humanitarian in intent, has led to significant cultural and social tensions. The AfD advocates for a controlled immigration policy that prioritizes integration and the preservation of German culture and security. This is not about xenophobia but about ensuring that Germany does not lose its identity in the quest for globalism. A nation must maintain its core values and cultural heritage to remain strong and united. 

Energy and Independence:

The energy policies pushed by current coalitions are not only economically costly but also geopolitically naive. Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power and rely heavily on coal and imported gas, plus highly variable wind and solar without the necessary grid-scale batteries to provide stability, has left it vulnerable, especially in light of energy supply disruptions. The AfD's stance on energy is pragmatic, advocating for a balanced approach. I hope they consider doubling down on safe nuclear power, together with battery energy storage to buffer large swings in electricity usage, as that is the obvious solution. 

Political Realism:

The traditional parties have failed Germany. Their policies have led to economic stagnation, social unrest, and a dilution of national identity. The AfD, despite being labeled far-right, offers a political realism that resonates with many Germans who feel their concerns are ignored by the establishment. They address the issues at hand without the political correctness that often masks the truth. 

The description of AfD as far-right is made obviously false simply by noting that Alice Weidel, the party leader has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please. 

 Innovation and the Future:

I've built companies on the principle that innovation requires freedom from unnecessary constraints. The AfD's vision aligns with this ethos. They push for educational reforms that encourage critical thinking over indoctrination and support tech industries which are the future of global economic leadership. 

To those who decry the AfD as extremist, I say, look beyond the labels. Look at the policies, the economic plans, and the cultural preservation efforts. Germany needs a party that isn't afraid to challenge the status quo, that isn't bogged down by the politics of the past.

The AfD can save Germany from becoming a shadow of its former self. It can steer the country towards a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity, and technological innovation are not just aspirations but realities. Germany has been too comfortable with mediocrity; it's time for bold changes, and the AfD is the only party offering that path.

As a friend of Elon and a Supervisory Board Member of Axel Springer, I saw his public support for the AfD on X as an opportunity for him to elaborate on his views in a more thoughtful and detailed way. I reached out to Jennifer Wilton, the editor-in-chief of Die Welt, to gauge her interest in an editorial from Elon on the subject. After careful consideration, she agreed that such a piece would be of significant news value and worthy of publication. I then approached Elon, explaining the potential impact of this opportunity to clarify his position. He liked the idea, wrote the article, and Die Welt published it.",8441,1150,433

2025-01-02 03:55:55+00:00,"Dear @elonmusk,

The way to free Tommy Robinson is through legal action. While he’s in prison he’s asked me to help with two urgent battles. Permit me to describe them for you, and all your followers:

1. Tommy was sentenced to 18 months in prison for publishing that documentary you just retweeted. The judge specifically referred to Twitter/X, and the video’s wide distribution when giving out the sentence. Tommy will likely be released in 9 months, but in the meantime he is being held in segregation (solitary confinement). No man can do nine months of solitary without major mental health damage — it’s a form of torture, like what was done to Julian Assange.

Remember, contempt of court in this case is a civil offence — not a crime. It’s outrageous and unprecedented that he be held in solitary, which is usually reserved for short-term punishments of violent prisoners who misbehave in prison. 

We have hired a lawyer who is an expert in prison law to challenge the way he is being held. We just received the reply from the prison governor, refusing to move Tommy from solitary, saying that he must stay there because of “the polarising nature of his ideology”. You can see that letter here: https://t.co/fuoU1eBIjs

We are moving quickly to appeal that prison governor’s decision in a judicial review. 

2. While Tommy is in prison, he is being charged with a bogus, trumped up charge under the Terrorism Act — a UK version of the Patriot Act. Obviously Tommy is not a terrorist (and police told him as much when they arrested him). They’re just using that extreme law to subject Tommy to questioning that he legally cannot refuse under the act and to search his phone without a warrant, as is also permitted in the act. Tommy refused to give police the password to his cell phone without a warrant (he had both legal and journalistic confidences in it), so they’re prosecuting him for that, too. 

For each of these two battles we need both a solicitor and a barrister (they’re different people in the UK). So we’re crowdfunding FOUR different lawyers. Frankly, we need help. 

Tommy has been debanked and deplatformed, so Tommy asked me and Rebel News to crowdfund his lawyers for him, which were doing at https://t.co/9znjumweQf

They really are throwing the unlimited resources of the state against him. Not for a crime, but for a political and journalistic disagreement.

I don’t think you’ll be able to change the mind of Keir Starmer, the authoritarian Prime Minister who used to be the UK’s chief prosecutor. But if you could help direct attention towards our legal crowdfund, I think we have a reasonable chance to get him into a more sensible prison for the rest of his sentence, and to swat down this bogus Terrorism Act charge.

Thanks!

“The OIG investigation found that three then Senior DOJ Officials violated DOJ’s Confidentiality and Media Contacts Policy by leaking to select reporters, days before an election, non-public DOJ investigative information regarding ongoing DOJ investigative matters, resulting in the publication of two news articles that included the non-public DOJ investigative information.”

“The OIG investigation also found that one of these three then Senior DOJ Officials violated the Confidentiality and Media Contacts Policy and DOJ’s Social Media Policy by reposting through a DOJ social media account links to the news articles.""

Based on context clues, the information they leaked likely pertained to the hoax the deep state tried to create about Egypt's President El-Sisi wanting to donate to Trump's 2016 campaign. I say this is likely true because Senator Chuck Grassley wrote a letter in August accusing the FBI & DOJ of the leaks.

The report has been provided to the DOJ official responsible for prosecuting Hatch Act violations.

SpaceX launched an incredible 362,087 kg of spacecraft into orbit in Q3 2024. Second place? 

China Aerospace, with 30,350 kg, while Arianespace struggled to remain relevant with just 14,760 kg—a fraction of SpaceX's output.

What does “’upmass’ mean?

Upmass is the total weight of all payloads launched into space, including satellites, research instruments, and equipment. 

It’s a critical measure of a company’s ability to support global communication, scientific research, and space exploration.

SpaceX didn’t just lead—it obliterated the competition, launching more than everyone else combined.

2024-12-28 20:12:47+00:00,"NEW: Marc Andreessen reveals how Trump's DOJ appointee, Harmeet Dhillon, is poised to demolish corporate DEI policies.

🔥🔥🔥

Dhillon, a fierce critic of woke corporate culture, is now leading the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.

""The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is the federal government’s prosecutorial arm that basically enforces wokeness. They’re the ones who have ensured that, for the last decade, these companies have had all these crazy policies under the penalty of being investigated, subpoenaed, and ultimately prosecuted.""

""The most famous case that the current head of the Civil Rights division brought was the case against SpaceX for not hiring enough refugees—notwithstanding that SpaceX is a military contractor and is not permitted to hire non-American citizens under a separate law.""

""Dhillon is brilliant, and she's the exact opposite of that.""

""Every signal is being sent that they’re going to do a 180 on all these things, and they’re going to begin prosecuting companies for violations of civil rights laws in the form of reverse discrimination—discrimination against white people, Asians, Jews, and other unprotected classes.""

""So, signals are being sent by these appointments that there will be an assault to reverse the assault that companies and universities have been under. And then, of course, the Supreme Court ruled not long ago that private universities are not allowed to do race-based admissions.""

""I think every major corporation in the country is just in flagrant violation of actual civil rights law. You cannot have these hard quotas and racially, ethnically, and religiously biased hiring practices. It’s flat-out illegal.""

""These companies have gone so extreme that they’ve ended up in what I think is clearly mass illegality. So, as Dhillon steps into her job, she won’t lack a shortage of targets. If you don’t want to be a target, it’s a great 'get out of jail free' card to voluntarily shut all this stuff down.""

""We’re already starting to see it. Boeing and a bunch of other companies have already put a bullet in their programs. Even the University of Michigan, which went completely overboard with this stuff, has shut their whole thing down.""

“I do worry about AI.

Because we are creating an intelligence that ultimately will be far more intelligent than any human, and ultimately more intelligent than the sum of all humans.

In creating AI, we need to be very careful.

It's like having a genius child: You want to have that child grow up with good values.

The most important thing in training AI is that it's rigorously truthful.

This is very, very important, essential.

My concern about a lot of the AIs that are being developed is that they're trained to lie.

In some cases, with potentially disastrous consequences.

When Google Gemini came out, people asked, which is worse, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner or global thermonuclear war?

And it said, misgendering Caitlyn Jenner.

That's a problem, guys.

If this AI becomes super powerful, it could decide that the best way to avoid misgendering is to kill all humans, which makes the probability of misgendering zero.

It's very important to have AI be maximally truthful and curious, and love humanity.

Very important.”

According to Grok 2, which I am currently most satisfied with, as of 2024, the number of X platform users in South Korea is estimated to be approximately 5 million, which is significantly low compared to the country's total population of about 50 million.

The primary cause of this phenomenon seems to be South Korea's somewhat elevated localized intellectual activities. For example, unlike K-pop’s global appeal, which is not closely related to intellectual activities, Google is estimated to hold only 30% of the search engine market share, while a South Korean company is projected to dominate with roughly 60%. (In contrast, Google is estimated to have a 90% search engine market share in the United States.)

To increase the usage of the X platform in South Korea, I believe South Koreans should strive for more ""globally"" connected intellectual activities, mainly with X as the central platform for this transformation. I aspire to be the ""SINGULARITY POINT"" of this monumental shift, engaging primarily through X to inspire such a revolution.",7365,931,630

While Democrats rage against Elon's ""unelected influence"" for exposing wasteful spending, a recent bombshell report reveals an unprecedented usurpation of executive power: Biden's presidency has been largely run by proxies, with cabinet members rarely gaining direct access to their commander-in-chief.

Even Treasury Secretary Yellen – traditionally one of the most important cabinet positions – was kept at arm's length, forced to communicate through intermediaries. 

Defense Secretary Austin's regular briefings became increasingly rare, even as wars erupted in Ukraine and Gaza. 

Cabinet members stopped requesting presidential access altogether, knowing such requests would be denied.

This wasn't mere delegation – it was institutional coverup. 

Where Obama actively engaged with his cabinet to debate policy, Biden's team created an impenetrable barrier of handlers who issued top-down directives with little presidential involvement.

Yet when Elon used X's transparency to trim a 1,547-page spending bill to 118 pages, these same Democrats decried his ""shadow"" influence. 

The hypocrisy is staggering – Washington would rather have unelected staffers secretly running the executive branch than face public scrutiny of its bloated spending.

The message is clear: the establishment will protect its own while fighting those who dare to lift the veil.",22382,7999,2135

2024-12-24 10:39:41+00:00,The Starlink ion thruster is a marvel of engineering,73462,9105,3369
2024-12-24 00:55:35+00:00,"Something old and something new in electric propulsion 🚀
The lower box is one the earliest spacecraft ion thrusters (from EOS circa 1962), and on top is a new arrival, a modern marvel from the SpaceX Starlink satellites used for on orbit maneuvering. SpaceX has mastered Argon Hall Effect thrusters, something no one else has been able to do.  This affords a higher power density (4.2kW in 2.1kg) and much lower cost gas (about $10 per satellite) than prior designs using Krypton or Xenon.  This is one of the early 2023 flight units for@Starlink V2 Mini, and the only one outside the company.

These thrusters are for in-space use only, and while they have relatively low thrust, they can run continuously for long periods with a very high ISP, and they are compact and reliable.  They are commonly used for satellite station keeping and interplanetary missions, where this Argon thruster could reduce a 5-year transit time to months.

The backside of the SpaceX thruster shows how simple it is, with gas lines and wires for the cathode and electrode, insulated with Boron Nitride on the other side and permanent magnets for lensing of the streams.

Ben Longmier, lead designer of the SpaceX thruster, helped identify the old one I had in my collection.  It appears to be “a development unit or early flight unit for a Cesium thruster from EOS (Electro-Optical Systems). The black component underneath the thruster looks to be the propellant tank and you can see several heaters wrapped around and brazed in place. A porous plug would have been used as a ‘valve,’ which takes advantage of a metal wetting and vapor pressure trick to throttle the propellant flow vs. temperature of the porous sintered metal plug.”

The final EOS thruster design is in the Smithsonian. It was successfully tested twice in space on flights of Air Force Blue Scout missiles in 1964.

Back in 1912, Goddard postulated that high-velocity streams of electrons and positive ions could be “energized” by solar-electric power supplies to provide thrust for an interplanetary spacecraft.  He went further to suggest that the source of the ions could come from exposing alkaline atoms, such as mercury or cesium, to hot tungsten surfaces.  He was spot on!

And more history from Ben: “One of the original Peenemunde rocket scientists on Von Braun’s team was Ernst Stuhlinger, who moved his family to what would become Marshall Spaceflight Center in Alabama. Ernst was close to Von Braun and worked on a lot of the early projects. In the later years of the US space program, both Ernst and Von Braun had dreams of expanding beyond the moon and sending craft deeper into the solar system, specifically Mars. One of Ernst’s concepts involved solar powered craft that would use Cesium ion thrusters to achieve a very high payload fraction delivered from Earth C3 to Mars injection orbit. This was an early solar electric propulsion concept that would ultimately never fly due to the wind down of budgets.”

And now, with the modern revival of a Mars program, the SpaceX Marslink satellites take us from dream to dream.

I borrow this phrase form the closing of Andrew Chaiken’s A Man on the Moon: “Historians of the far future may look back on Apollo and the missions that are yet to come as one great Age of Space Exploration.  But in my mind’s eye it is a slow dissolve, from memory to anticipation, from what has been to what will be, from dream to dream.”",7676,1312,380

2024-12-24 07:41:33+00:00,"RT @heydave7: Here are some notes on the anti-billionaire ideology - and why it might do more harm than good:

At the heart of the frustration with wealth inequality - especially among younger people - are several overlapping ideas. Broadly, they stem from the following premises:

1. Zero-Sum View of Wealth:
Many who rail against “billionaire greed” subscribe to an implicit zero-sum assumption that if the rich are gaining wealth, it must be coming at the direct expense of everyone else. This perspective sees the economic pie as fixed; a bigger slice for billionaires means a smaller slice for ordinary people.

2. Moral Indictment of Profit:
There is also an underlying moral stance that profits at very high levels are inherently exploitative. Under this view, earning billions can only happen through unethical means - mistreating workers, hiking prices, or bending regulations.

3. Suspicion of Capitalism Itself:
An increasingly vocal segment of young people critiques market economies as rigged or fundamentally unjust. They note that, in their eyes, capitalism privileges capital (ownership) at the expense of labor (wages), and perpetuates a system that traps people in lower socioeconomic strata.

4. Focus on “Equality of Outcome” Over “Equality of Opportunity”:
The critique often goes beyond wanting fair chances for everyone. Instead, it emphasizes the relative gap between the top and bottom, rejecting the idea that big disparities can exist even when upward mobility is possible.

5. Conflation of Net Worth With Liquid Cash:
A common misconception is that billionaires have all their “net worth” in spendable forms. In reality, most wealth is tied up in assets (stock in a company, real estate, etc.). This fuels the anger because it appears that billionaires “hoard” money and choose not to share it.

Why These Ideas Can Be Misleading or Harmful

1. Zero-Sum Thinking Overlooks Wealth Creation
In many industries—think technology, medicine, communications—total wealth isn’t static. When someone creates a product or service that millions of people value (like smartphones, software, or life-saving drugs), it grows the economic pie. That’s not to say exploitative practices don’t exist, but simplistic zero-sum frameworks gloss over the dynamic, generative nature of innovation.

2. Misplaced Moral Indictment
Painting all (or most) large-scale profit as immoral doesn’t address nuances: there are ethical ways to build wealth (improving supply chains, investing in local communities, fair business practices) and unethical ways (sweatshops, unfair contracts, environmental destruction). Lumping all billionaires into the “bad guy” category overlooks differences between, say, a biotech founder who develops critical medicines versus a predatory lender.

3. Ignoring the Benefits of Investment
Much billionaire wealth can be tied to investments that themselves foster economic growth and job creation. When venture capitalists fund startups, they often take on significant risk. While it can lead to high personal returns, it also creates industries (and jobs) from the ground up. The ideology that all returns on investments are undeserved fails to account for the role that investment plays in building healthy economies.

4. Weakening Incentives Kills Innovation
When the system heavily penalizes individuals who become extremely successful, it removes the natural “carrot” that drives ambitious endeavors. Launching a startup or spearheading a major breakthrough usually involves massive risks — entrepreneurs sacrifice time, money, and personal stability on a venture that might fail. If the potential rewards are cut off or capped too drastically, fewer people will bother to take the leap. This doesn’t just affect a handful of hopeful billionaires; it reverberates throughout society as whole industries and transformative ideas (whether in medicine, clean energy, or technology) never get off the ground. In other words, when wealth creation stops being worthwhile, everyone loses out on progress, jobs, and critical innovations that improve lives.

5. “Taxing Billionaires Out of Existence” Derails Society
This approach doesn’t just strip personal fortunes; it severs the capital fueling innovation, startups, and major philanthropic efforts. Without high-stakes investments, lifesaving research and transformative technologies often stall. A scorched-earth method of “leveling wealth” might sound fair, but it ultimately starves society of the breakthroughs and funding necessary for widespread progress.

Yes, young adults face serious economic pressures - from soaring housing costs to student debt - but framing every concern as “wealth inequality” injects a needless negativity that can distort the real issues.  A more constructive focus is keeping living costs down and creating a robust, opportunity-rich economy. That means controlling inflation - primarily through efficient government spending and lower national debt - while removing barriers to innovation and enterprise. By prioritizing stable monetary policy, competitive markets, and better education, we give more people the tools to thrive, rather than just harping on “inequality.”",0,1766,0
