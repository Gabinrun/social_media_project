Lace Lithography gives this book to all of their employees, and I can see why, given the extreme economic dependencies we have on ASML and TSMC today, and the geopolitical power that derives from the advanced alchemy of computation.

The early history of the semiconductor industry was the most interesting part to me, as my father lived through it, starting at Motorola in 1966, then Texas Instruments and Mostek, the leader in memory chips in the early 80‚Äôs.

Chip War does not pull any punches when it comes to the failings of Russia, China and Intel. So, I keep it with my Intel wafer of 100Mhz Pentiums, a gift of Gordon Moore, signed by one of my favorite Professors, Andy Grove.

Here are the passages that caught my eye or packed the most punch:

‚ÄúLast year the chip industry produced more transistors than the combined quantity of all goods produced by all other companies, in all other industries, in all human history.  Nothing else comes close.‚Äù (p.xxi)

‚ÄúAround a quarter of the chip industry‚Äôs revenue comes from phones.  Today, Apple‚Äôs most advanced processors can only be produced by a single company in a single building, the most expensive factory in human history.‚Äù (p.xx)

‚Ä¢¬†Chip History  ‚Äî U.S. vs. USSR

‚ÄúAt the outset, the integrated circuit cost 50x as much to make as a simpler device made with separate components wired together.  Everyone agreed Noyce‚Äôs invention was clever, even brilliant. All it needed was a market.  Three days after Noyce and Moore founded Fairchild Semiconductor, the answer to the question of who would pay for integrated circuits hurtled over their heads: Sputnik, the world‚Äôs first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union.  Boy Noyce suddenly had a market for his integrated circuits: rockets.  The first big order for Noyce‚Äôs chips came from NASA.‚Äù (19)

‚ÄúBy November 1962, Charles Stark Draper, the famed engineer who run the MIT Instrumentation Lab had decided to bet on Fairchild chips for the Apollo program.  The computer that eventually took Apollo 11 to the moon weighed 70 pounds and took up about one cubic foot of space, a thousand times less than the ENIAC computer that had calculated artillery trajectories in World War II.  MIT considers the Apollo guidance computer one of its proudest accomplishments.‚Äù (20)  I have the second one that they made: https://t.co/RR7RXSeCH6

‚ÄúNASA‚Äôs trust in integrated circuits to guide astronauts to the moon was an important stamp of approval.‚Äù (21)

In 1963, ‚ÄúTI‚Äôs shipments to the Air Force accounted for 60% of all dollars spent buying chips to date.  By the end of 1964, Texas Instruments had supplied 100,000 integrated circuits to the Minuteman missile program.‚Äù (22)  A peek inside: https://t.co/41Qg1QGJvJ

‚ÄúIn 1965, military and space applications would use over 95% of the integrated circuits produced that year.‚Äù (29)

‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs Law was the greatest technological prediction of the century. Moore later argued that Noyce‚Äôs price cuts were as big an innovation as the technology inside the integrated circuits.‚Äù (31)

‚ÄúIn 1966, Burroughs, a computer firm, ordered 20 million chips from Fairchild ‚Äî more than 20x what the Apollo program consumed.  By 1968, the computer industry was buying as many chips as the military.‚Äù (32)

‚ÄúCopying was literally hardwired into the Soviet semiconductor industry, with some chipmaking machinery using inches rather than centimeters to better replicate American designs, even though the rest of the USSR used the metric system.  The Soviet ‚Äòcopy it‚Äô strategy was fundamentally flawed, however. Copying worked in building nuclear weapons, because the U.S. and the USSR built only tens of thousands of nukes over the entire Cold War.‚Äù (43)

They could not keep up with Moore‚Äôs Law.  ‚ÄúIn 1985, the CIA conducted a study of Soviet microprocessors and found that the USSR produced replicas of Intel and Motorola chips like clockwork.  They were always a half decade behind.‚Äù (144)

‚ÄúThe KGB began stealing semiconductor manufacturing equipment too. The system of theft and replication never worked well enough to convince Soviet military leaders that they had a steady supply of quality chips, so they minimized the use of electronics and computers in military systems.‚Äù (143)

‚ÄúJapan alone spent 8x as much on capital investment in microelectronics as the USSR.‚Äù (149)

‚ÄúThe problem with many guided munitions, the military concluded, was the vacuum tubes.  The Sparrow missile‚Äôs radar system broke on average once every 5 to 10 hours of use. A post war study found that only 9.2% of Sparrows fired in Vietnam hit their target, while 66% malfunctioned, and the rest simply missed.‚Äù (58)  Same for the Bullpup I have in the office: https://t.co/hcOJ9USuJh

‚ÄúEven the vacuum-tube-powered Sidewinder air-to-air missiles that missed most of their targets above Vietnam were upgraded with semiconductor-based guidance systems.  They were 6x as accurate in the Persian Gulf War as in Vietnam.‚Äù (153) I have Serial Number 1 of the Sidewinder, and wrote a little review of the book by the same name: https://t.co/LZXMgCGfw5

‚ÄúA simple laser sensor and a couple transistors turned a weapon with a zero-for-638 hit ratio into a tool of precision destruction. Outside a small number of military theorists and engineers, hardly anyone realized Vietnam had been a successful testing ground for weapons that married microelectronics and explosives in ways that would revolutionize warfare and transform American military power.‚Äù (61) Like AI + drones in Ukraine today.

‚ÄúIf the future of war became a contest for accuracy, the Soviets would fall behind.  Guided missiles would not only offset the USSR‚Äôs quantitative advantage, they‚Äôd force the Soviets to undertake a ruinously expensive anti-missile effort in response.‚Äù (75)

‚ÄúSoviet estimates suggested that if the U.S. launched a nuclear first strike in the 1980‚Äôs, it could have disabled or destroyed 98% of Soviet ICBMs.‚Äù (147)

‚ÄúThe Iraqi military ‚Äî armed with some of the best equipment the Soviet Union‚Äôs defense industry produced ‚Äî¬†was helpless in the wake of the American assault.  The reverberations of the smart bombs were felt as powerfully in Moscow as in Baghdad.‚Äù (154)

‚ÄúThe Russian chip industry faced humiliation, with one fab reduced in the 1990s to producing tiny chips for McDonald‚Äôs Happy Meal toys.  The Cold War was over; Silicon Valley had won.‚Äù (159)

‚Ä¢¬†Japan

‚ÄúSony‚Äôs research director, the famed physicist Makoto Kikuchi told an American journalist that Japan had fewer geniuses than America, a country with ‚Äòoutstanding elites.‚Äô But America also had a ‚Äòlong tail‚Äô of people ‚Äòwith less than normal intelligence,‚Äô Kikuchi argued, explaining why Japan was better at mass manufacturing.‚Äù (83)

‚ÄúIn 1985, Japanese firms spent 46% of the world‚Äôs capital expenditures on semiconductors, compared to America‚Äôs 35%.‚Äù (89)  That was the year they ruined Mostek, where my Dad ran the world‚Äôs largest memory chip fabs at the time: https://t.co/OND8Y2fRjN

‚Äú‚ÄôWe‚Äôre in a death spiral,‚Äô Bob Noyce told a reporter in 1986. In the late 1980s, Intel‚Äôs equipment was running only 30% of the time due to maintenance and repairs‚Äù (106)

In 1989, Shintaro Ishihara wrote: ‚ÄúJapan has nearly a 100% share of 1-megabit semiconductors. Japan is at least five years ahead of the United Stated and the gap is widening.‚Äù (112)

‚Ä¢¬†China

‚ÄúMany of the best graduates from China‚Äôs universities before the revolution ended up working in Taiwan or in California. The year after China produced its first integrated circuit, Mao plunged the company into the Cultural Revolution, arguing that expertise was a source of privilege that undermined socialist equality.‚Äù (172)  ...some sad echoes of that today.

‚ÄúDuring the decade in which China had descended into revolutionary chaos, Intel had invented microprocessors, while Japan had grabbed a large share of the global DRAM market. China accomplished nothing beyond harassing its smartest citizens.‚Äù (174)

‚ÄúA study in 1979 found that China had hardly any commercially viable semiconductor production and only 1500 computers in the entire country.‚Äù (175)

‚ÄúU.S. fabs made 37% of the world‚Äôs chips in 1990, but this number fell to 19% by 2000 and 13% by 2010. South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan rapidly increased output.‚Äù (177)

‚ÄúNo country has been more successful than China at harnessing the digital world for authoritarian purposes.‚Äù (244)

‚ÄúChina has less than 1% of the global software tools market.  China supplies 4% of the of the world‚Äôs silicon wafers and other chipmaking materials. It has only a 7% market share in the business of fabricating chips. None of this fabrication capacity involves high-value, leading-edge technology.‚Äù (249)

‚ÄúThe future of war will be defined by computing power‚Ä¶ a belief in the Chinese military circles that warfare is being ‚Äòintelligentized‚Äô ‚Äî¬†inelegant military jargon that means applying AI to weapons systems.‚Äù (284)

‚Äú29% of the world‚Äôs leading researchers in AI are from China, as opposed to 20% from the U.S. and 18% from Europe.  However, a staggering share of these experts end up working in the U.S., which employs 59% of the world‚Äôs top AI researchers.‚Äù (286)

‚ÄúChina is still staggeringly dependent on foreign semiconductor technology ‚Äî¬†in particular, U.S.-designed, Taiwan-fabricated processors ‚Äî to undertake complex computation.  95% of GPUs in Chinese servers running AI workloads are designed by NVIDIA.‚Äù (286)

‚ÄúThe U.S. military will only succeed if it has a decisive technological advantage. The 1970s offset was driven by digital microprocessors, IT, sensors, stealth.  This time it will be advances in AI and autonomy.‚Äù (287)

‚ÄúObama‚Äôs China team concluded ‚Äòthat everything we‚Äôre competing on in the 21st Century, all of it rests on the cornerstone of semiconductor mastery.‚Äù (300)

‚ÄúEscalating tech competition with the United States is like a Sputnik moment for China‚Äôs government.‚Äù (320)

‚ÄúEstablishing a cutting-edge, all-domestic supply chain would take over a decade and cost well over a trillion dollars in that period. This is why, despite the rhetoric, China‚Äôs not actually pursuing an all-domestic supply chain.  Beijing recognizes this is simply impossible.‚Äù (323)

‚ÄúChina now spends more money each year importing chips than it spends on oil.‚Äù (p.xviii)

‚Ä¢¬†Taiwan

‚ÄúTSMC‚Äôs Fab 18 fabricated well over 1 quintillion transistors.‚Äù (p.xxi)

‚ÄúTaiwan fabricates 37% of the world‚Äôs logic chips.  After a disaster in Taiwan, the total costs would be measured in the trillions.  It would take at least half a decade to rebuild the lost chipmaking capacity.‚Äù (341)

‚Ä¢ Lithography

‚ÄúASML builds 100% of the world‚Äôs extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, without which cutting edge chips are simply impossible to make. OPEC‚Äôs 40% share of world oil production looks unimpressive by comparison.‚Äù (p.xxv)

In 1986, the U.S. pioneer ‚ÄúGCA lost its position as the only company building steppers. Japan‚Äôs Nikon had initially been a partner of GCA, providing the precision lenses for its stepper.  It acquired a machine from GCA and reverse engineered it.  Soon Nikon had more market share than GCA.‚Äù (94)

‚ÄúGCA struggled with mass production. Precision manufacturing was essential, since lithography was now so exact that a thunderstorm rolling through could change air pressure ‚Äî and thus the angle at which light refracted ‚Äî enough to distort the images carved on chips.‚Äù (94)

‚ÄúBy the end of the 1980s, Japan was supplying 70% of the world‚Äôs lithography equipment. America‚Äôs share had fallen to 21%.‚Äù (99)

‚ÄúIntel would eventually spend billions of dollars on R&D and billions more learning how to use EUV to carve chips.  It never planned to make its own EUV equipment‚Äù (184)

‚ÄúThe manufacturing of EUV wasn‚Äôt globalized, it was monopolized.  A single supply chain managed by a single company [ASML] would control the future of lithography.‚Äù (189)

‚ÄúEUV was one of the biggest technological gambles of our time.  Intel alone invested $4B in ASML in 2012, an investment that followed billions of dollars of previous grants and investments Intel had spent on EUV, dating back to the era of Andy Grove.‚Äù (225)

‚ÄúProducing enough EUV light requires pulverizing a small ball of tin with a laser. The tin is struck twice with a laser.  The first pulse is to warm it up, the second is to blast it into a plasma with a temperature around a half million degrees, many times hotter than the surface of the sun. This process is then repeated 50,000 times per second to produce EUV light in the quantities necessary to fabricate chips.‚Äù (226)  The laser needed ultrapure diamond windows, multi-layer mirrors that are smoother than any other object manufactured, and each machine had 457,329 parts and cost over $100M each.  Their new high-aperture EUV machine costs $300M each.

‚ÄúASML‚Äôs EUV lithography tool is the most expensive mass-produced machine tool in history, so complex it‚Äôs impossible to use without extensive training from ASML personnel, who remain on-site for the tool‚Äôs entire life span.‚Äù (230)

‚ÄúChapter 41: How Intel Forgot Innovation.  The company spent over $10 billion a year on R&D throughout the 2010s, four times as much as TSMC. Only a couple companies in the world spent more. Intel has now spent half a decade announcing ‚Äòtemporary‚Äô manufacturing delays.  Most people in the industry think many of the company‚Äôs problems stem from Intel‚Äôs delayed adoption of EUV tools. By 2020, half of all EUV lithography tools, funded and nurtured by Intel, were installed at TSMC.  By contrast, Intel had only barely begun to use EUV in its manufacturing process.‚Äù (240)",637,120,41

After the release of GPT-4 in March 2023, the dominant narrative in the tech world was that continued scaling of models would lead to artificial general intelligence and then superintelligence. Those extreme predictions gradually receded, but up until a month ago, the prevailing belief in the AI industry was that model scaling would continue for the foreseeable future.

Then came three back-to-back news reports from The Information, Reuters, and Bloomberg revealing that three leading AI developers ‚Äî OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini ‚Äî had all run into problems with their next-gen models. Many industry insiders, including Ilya Sutskever, probably the most notable proponent of scaling, are now singing a very different tune:

‚ÄúThe 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing,‚Äù Sutskever said. ‚ÄúScaling the right thing matters more now than ever.‚Äù (Reuters)

The new dominant narrative seems to be that model scaling is dead, and ‚Äúinference scaling‚Äù, also known as ‚Äútest-time compute scaling‚Äù is the way forward for improving AI capabilities. The idea is to spend more and more computation when using models to perform a task, such as by having them ‚Äúthink‚Äù before responding.

2024-12-18 22:34:46+00:00,"Everything you love about generative models ‚Äî now powered by real physics!

Announcing the Genesis project ‚Äî after a 24-month large-scale research collaboration involving over 20 research labs ‚Äî a generative physics engine able to generate 4D dynamical worlds powered by a physics simulation platform designed for general-purpose robotics and physical AI applications.

Genesis's physics engine is developed in pure Python, while being 10-80x faster than existing GPU-accelerated stacks like Isaac Gym and MJX. It delivers a simulation speed ~430,000 faster than in real-time, and takes only 26 seconds to train a robotic locomotion policy transferrable to the real world on a single RTX4090 (see tutorial: https://t.co/bEkIlCKqdf).

The Genesis physics engine and simulation platform is fully open source at https://t.co/DhBv7NdyqH. We'll gradually roll out access to our generative framework in the near future.

Genesis implements a unified simulation framework all from scratch, integrating a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art physics solvers, allowing simulation of the whole physical world in a virtual realm with the highest realism.

We aim to build a universal data engine that leverages an upper-level generative framework to autonomously create physical worlds, together with various modes of data, including environments, camera motions, robotic task proposals, reward functions, robot policies, character motions, fully interactive 3D scenes, open-world articulated assets, and more, aiming towards fully¬†automated data generation for robotics, physical AI and other applications.

2023-10-24 19:05:40+00:00,"Can reinforcement learning from AI feedback unlock new capabilities in AI agents?

Introducing Motif, an LLM-powered method for intrinsic motivation from AI feedback. Motif extracts reward functions from Llama 2's preferences and uses them to train agents with reinforcement learning.

On the complex NetHack game, Motif solves previously unsolved tasks without needing any expert demonstrations. Surprisingly, Motif's reward leads to better game score than the one obtained by using the score itself as a reward.

Given access to an event captioning mechanism, a few properties make Motif a general method:
 ‚Ä¢ it is entirely based on open models
 ‚Ä¢ the LLM doesn't need direct access to the environment dynamics (e.g., its source code)
 ‚Ä¢ the LLM doesn't need to understand observation and action spaces

The best part? You can start using Motif right now, even on a small compute budget: the whole pipeline can take less than two GPU-days.

2024-12-10 11:22:50+00:00,"RT @jsm2334: My colleagues and I just published a paper in eClinicalMedicine evaluating effects of vaccination on long COVID risks in children and adolescents during the Delta and early Omicron periods.   

These data were from the RECOVER network including 21 pediatric hospital networks from all over the USA, including 112,590 adolescents during the Delta period, and 84,735 adolescents and 188,894 children during the early Omicron period.

Long COVID-19 (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, PASC, or multi-system inflammatory syndrom, MIS) was defined using a symptom-based computable phenotype definition based on five body systems.

Our analyses utilized propensity score weighting to adjust for confounding from age, demographics, medical co-morbidities as well as healthcare utilization including past COVID-19 testing practices, and we used proximal analyses with negative control exposures and outcomes to investigate and adjust for potential residual bias from unmeasured confounders.

In adolescents 12-20yrs, we found vaccination resulted in 95.4% reduced risk of long COVID-19 during the Delta period, and 75.1% during the Omicron period.

In children 5-11yrs, we found vaccination resulted in 60.2% reduced risk of long COVID-19 during he Omicron period.

To evaluate how much of this vaccine protection was from reduced risk of infection and how much was reduced risk of long COVID-19 independent of any effect in reducing infection, we performed a causal mediation analysis to split the total vaccine effect into indirect effects, mediated through reducing risk of infection, and direct effects, independent of any reduced risk of infection.  

Again, propensity score weighting was used to carefully adjust for potential confounders.  

We found that the protective effect of vaccines on long COVID-19 was almost wholly mediated through its reduced risk of infection.

Various sensitivity analyses were done and included in the online supplement along with a detailed description and explanation of all methods and modeling decisions.

The rest of the tweet is about something very important that we scientists and engineers in AI need to talk about. 

California corporations are forcing existing employees in the UK and Europe to sign 6 month to 1 year non-competes. These contracts are not signed at the start, but after many years when the companies have disproportionate power over the employees. Imagine receiving a promotion because of merit and hard work, being happy about it because you‚Äôre starting a new family, but being told that you won‚Äôt get it unless you sign a 1 year non-compete. It is not easy to leave the job then. It‚Äôs hopeless for the scientist, engineer or any other worker.

So you sign. You then cannot leave because you won‚Äôt be able to do AI research for a long time, and some of your promised money isn‚Äôt paid. It is emotionally abusive and terrible for scientific progress and technological development.

The AI companies that enforce this in London and European capitals don‚Äôt do it in California. This puts Europe at a huge disadvantage too. It‚Äôs non-competitive.

These are the companies claiming they are building the good AIs. Good? No, they are building AIs to exploit the laws of countries, created for other purposes, to exploit people. 

@GoogleDeepMind is particularly bad at this. They have been forcing researchers going up for promotion based on merit to sign 6 month non-competes, 1 year non solicits, and 6 month notice periods (garden leaves). This has made it clear that they don‚Äôt trust their own employees and will do whatever it takes to stifle their competition. Researchers leaving have been forced to comply.

The ironic thing is that they can‚Äôt enforce this in their California home. The executives don‚Äôt believe in it. They are exploiting our laws to their benefit. 

Colleagues and friends (@icmlconf @NeurIPSConf @theinformation). Do NOT sign these contracts. They can‚Äôt make you do it. Without us engineers and AI people, their stock is worthless. Don‚Äôt let them abuse you. This applies to people joining my team, do not sign these restrictions on your freedom to do research and work.

@GoogleDeepMind has wonderful people and very dear friends of mine who I look up to, but this practice of @Google should be illegal. It should be illegal for other corporations too because it stifles research in AI and progress. It is also pathetic. @GoogleDeepMind can do much better: Do the right thing and make us proud please.

The European Union @vestager should do something about this. It should be illegal and companies should be punished if they choose to stifle competition in Europe.",0,33,0

In the past few weeks alone, two different Chinese firms released excellent open source o1 style reasoning models, (DeepSeek R1 and Alibaba's QwQ) and Alibaba released Modelscope, an absolutely fantastic alternative to HuggingFace. Even better is the Alibaba backed open source ms-swift framework and it is hands down the best fine tuning and inference system on the planet with support for thousands of models and lightning fast support for the latest and most cutting edge models almost as soon as they drop, whereas other frameworks take weeks or months to support a new model, maybe.

Here's how DeepSeek talks about their privately funded race to build AGI in the article below: 

""Deepseek‚Äôs strategy is grounded in their ambition to build AGI. Unlike previous spins on the theme, Deepseek‚Äôs mission statement does not mention safety, competition, or stakes for humanity, but only ‚Äúunraveling the mystery of AGI with curiosity‚Äù. Accordingly, the lab has been laser-focused on research into potentially game-changing architectural and algorithmic innovations.""

No safety and self aggrandizing nonsense to be found anywhere. No self-aggrandizing talk about how important they are. Just building for the pure love and curiosity for it.

Like we used to do.

Max Tegmark is a fool when he talks about how the Chinese won't allow or want AGI. It's just sheer idiocy at every level and a completely childish understanding of basic human psychology and the psychology of nation states and systems. 

Nation states have always competed to have the best technology and they always will. 

Every empire of the past and present was built on having the best tech. See the Chinese in the past and soon the future, the Dutch, Spanish, Greeks, Romans, Spanish, French, and Portuguese of the past. And see America now.

I've said it before and I will say it again, the Chinese are winning the open source race.

AI existential risk fanatics will tell you it's all about saving the world. Nobody appointed these self-anointed heroes to save the world and the world doesn't need their help.  There is zero evidence that these systems have the capabilities to do the things they imagine in their dark fantasies. We don't have the techniques/algorithms or methods to create machines that we ""lose control"" of or ""go Foom"" in the night or grow sentient or become super persuaders or be a bio risk. There is no evidence in reality just in their imagination and it is based on absolutely nothing but ""if we get these magical properties of AI that don't actually exist now bad stuff happens.""

Great, talk to me when you can point to a shred of evidence other than ""some experts say so"" or ""scaling laws"". Appeals to authority mean absolutely nothing and the heads of big labs telling us we'll have AGI next week have billions in interest to say it.

Meanwhile, while we have no evidence at all of x-risk, we have a massive amount of historical evidence of the importance of open source. It's worth trillions of dollars in positive economic development. It built the modern software world, from the cloud, to super computers, to your phone, to the router in your house.

So we are trading trillions in potential future economic development and soft power for imaginary fantasies about what might happen with no actual evidence to point to about how it will happen.

China is winning the next century.

We better get our heads out of our ass.

I hope Musk slashes the government down to nothing or we will be an empire of the past, like so many before us.

I have posted the English translation below:

‚ÄúDear President-elect Donald Trump,

I am writing to you regarding your statement on Monday, November 25, concerning migration, fentanyl trafficking, and tariffs.

You may not be aware that Mexico has developed a comprehensive policy to assist migrants from different parts of the world who cross our territory en route to the southern border of the United States. As a result, and according to data from your country‚Äôs Customs and Border Protection (CBP), encounters at the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border have decreased by 75% between December 2023 and November 2024. Moreover, half of those who arrive do so through a legally scheduled appointment under the United States‚Äô CBP One program. For these reasons, migrant caravans no longer arrive at the border.

Even so, it is clear that we must work together to create a new labor mobility model that is necessary for your country, as well as address the root causes that compel families to leave their homes out of necessity. If even a small percentage of what the United States allocates to war were instead dedicated to building peace and fostering development, it would address the underlying causes of human mobility.

On another note, and for humanitarian reasons, Mexico has consistently expressed its willingness to help prevent the fentanyl epidemic in the United States from continuing. This is, after all, a public health and consumption problem within your society. So far this year, Mexican armed forces and prosecutors have seized tons of various types of drugs, 10,340 firearms, and have detained 15,640 individuals for violence related to drug trafficking.

Furthermore, the Mexican Congress is in the process of approving a constitutional reform to classify the production, distribution, and commercialization of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs as a serious crime without bail. However, it is publicly known that the chemical precursors used to produce this and other synthetic drugs are illegally entering Canada, the United States, and Mexico from Asian countries. This underscores the urgent need for international collaboration.
You must also be aware of the illegal trafficking of firearms into my country from the United States.

Seventy percent of the illegal weapons seized from criminals in Mexico come from your country. We do not produce these weapons, nor do we consume synthetic drugs. Tragically, it is in our country that lives are lost to the violence resulting from meeting the drug demand in yours.

President Trump, migration and drug consumption in the United States cannot be addressed through threats or tariffs. What is needed is cooperation and mutual understanding to tackle these significant challenges.

For every tariff, there will be a response in kind, until we put at risk our shared enterprises. Yes, shared. For instance, among Mexico‚Äôs main exporters to the United States are General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford Motor Company, which arrived in Mexico 80 years ago. Why impose a tariff that would jeopardize them? Such a measure would be unacceptable and would lead to inflation and job losses in both the United States and Mexico.

I am convinced that North America‚Äôs economic strength lies in maintaining our trade partnership. This allows us to remain competitive against other economic blocs. For this reason, I believe that dialogue is the best path to understanding, peace, and prosperity for our nations. I hope our teams can meet soon to continue building joint solutions.‚Äù",0,21485,0

They also have lower rates of poverty, crime, and chronic illness. Trump-won states, in contrast, face higher poverty, more gun violence, higher incarceration, and more chronic disease prevalence.

Economic Performance

‚Ä¢GDP Contribution: Harris-won states contribute a larger share of the national GDP (53%) compared to Trump-won states (47%), even though they represent a smaller number of states. This higher economic output correlates with generally higher incomes, greater population density in urban areas, and a concentration of industries like technology and finance, which tend to generate higher GDP.

‚Ä¢Median Household Income: The median household income in Harris-won states is significantly higher, with an average above $80,000, compared to below $50,000 in Trump-won states. This suggests a disparity in economic opportunity, wage levels, and possibly cost of living, with Harris-won states generally offering higher-paying jobs.

Public Health Indicators

‚Ä¢Life Expectancy: Residents in Harris-won states have a higher average life expectancy (around 80 years) compared to Trump-won states (approximately 75 years). This difference may be influenced by factors such as access to healthcare, lifestyle, and economic conditions, which can directly impact overall health outcomes.

‚Ä¢Child and Maternal Mortality: Both child and maternal mortality rates are notably lower in Harris-won states, suggesting better access to healthcare services, more robust public health systems, and potentially better social safety nets.

‚Ä¢Chronic Disease and Disability: Trump-won states show higher rates of chronic disease (55% vs. 40%) and a larger percentage of the population on disability (15% vs. 9%). These metrics may indicate challenges with healthcare accessibility, preventive care, and lifestyle factors.

Social and Crime Indicators

‚Ä¢Incarceration Rate: Trump-won states have a significantly higher incarceration rate (1,094 per 100,000) compared to Harris-won states (275 per 100,000). This may reflect differences in criminal justice policies, socioeconomic conditions, and crime rates, with higher incarceration often associated with poverty and limited access to social services.

‚Ä¢Violent Crime and Gun Violence: Violent crime and gun-related mortality are higher in Trump-won states. Gun violence, specifically, is considerably more prevalent (29.6 vs. 3.7 per 100,000), suggesting possible differences in gun laws, cultural attitudes towards firearms, and socioeconomic pressures that contribute to crime.

Education and Poverty Indicators

‚Ä¢Educational Attainment: Harris-won states have a higher percentage of residents with at least a bachelor‚Äôs degree (40% vs. 25%). Higher educational attainment is often linked to better job prospects, higher incomes, and overall economic growth, which could partially explain the income and GDP differences.

‚Ä¢Poverty and Hunger: Poverty and hunger rates are higher in Trump-won states, with poverty at 16% compared to 9% in Harris-won states, and hunger at 18% vs. 10%. These disparities suggest greater economic hardship and food insecurity in Trump-won states, likely affecting overall quality of life and contributing to poorer health outcomes.

Key Takeaways

1.Economic and Educational Advantages in Harris-Won States: Higher GDP, median income, and educational attainment in Harris-won states indicate stronger economic foundations, which support better living standards and health outcomes.

2.Public Health and Crime Challenges in Trump-Won States: Trump-won states face significant challenges related to public health, with higher rates of chronic disease, disability, maternal and child mortality, as well as crime and gun violence. These factors reflect systemic issues in healthcare access, economic conditions, and public health issues.üßµ

The book opens with a meeting Chivers had in Berkeley with Paul Crowley, who told him, ""I don't expect your children to die of old age.""

Chivers came from the UK to Berkeley because ""over the years, I became more involved with the Rationalists. I started reading their websites; I learned the jargon, all these terms like 'paperclip maximizer' and 'Pascal‚Äôs mugging.'""

""The key text ‚Äì the holy book, according to those who think the whole thing is a quasi-religion ‚Äì is a huge series of blog posts"" by Eliezer Yudkowsky, ""which came to be known as the Sequences."" 
Having read them, Chivers provides many explainers of various rationalists' thought experiments.

The story unfolds through the Extropians mailing list, Yudkowsky's SL4 (Shock Level 4) mailing list, the launch of LessWrong in 2009, Slate Star Codex in 2013, and Bostrom's ""Superintelligence"" book in 2014 that served as a turning point.

It then describes the idea of FOOM, Roko's Basilisk hysteria, putting numbers on everything (even if they are estimates), thus thinking probabilistically and making humans better Bayesians (rational Bayesian optimizers), utilitarianism (shut up and multiply) and its effect on AI Safety (if you believe in AI existential risk), how the movement attracts man on the autistic spectrum, and the arrangement of polyamory and group homes.

The ""dark sides"" are briefly discussed by Chivers:

""They do share a lot of the surface features of a cult: a charismatic figurehead and other high-status inner-circle members; a key text that in-group members are supposed to have read, and which encodes the central tenets of their 'belief'; unorthodox sexual practices; a message of impending apocalypse, and a promise of eternal life; and a way to donate money to avoid that apocalypse and achieve paradise.""

He ties it to the Effective Altruism movement by quoting David Gerard:
""Clearly, the most cost-effective initiative possible for all of humanity is donating to fight the prospect of unfriendly artificial intelligence, and oh look, there just happens to be a charity for that precise purpose right here! WHAT ARE THE ODDS.""

However, Chivers defends the movement shortly thereafter, stating that they are just ""nonconformists."" To find further criticism of the movement, he mentions a Reddit page called ""/r/sneerclub."" He does not recommend reading it. I am.

Throughout the chapters, Chivers gradually embraces the notion that AI will wipe out humanity. To solve the dissonance and stress it caused, he met with Anna Salamon, president and co-founder of CFAR (Center for Applied Rationality). What was the goal of their meeting? Her ""Internal Double Crux"" (debugging) session.
As he finished the inner debate, he broke down in tears, realizing that, indeed, he might not see his children ""die of old age.""

Totally sold on Yudkowsky's claim that ""AI will kill EVERYONE,"" Chivers became an even more ardent supporter of the movement. So he celebrates its achievement: ""What they have achieved in terms of the AI debate is, I think, remarkable. They've taken the niche, practically dystopian-science-fiction idea of AI risk and made people take it seriously."" It's no longer in the realm of ""fringe nerds on an email list.""

To conclude, he ends his book with this sentence:

""There is a small but non-negligible probability that, when we look back on this era in the future, we'll think that Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nick Bostrom ‚Äì and the SL4 email list, and LessWrong ‚Äì have saved the world.""

Chivers came from the UK to Berkeley because ""over the years, I became more involved with the Rationalists. I started reading their websites; I learned the jargon, all these terms like 'paperclip maximizer' and 'Pascal‚Äôs mugging.'""

There is a tendency among some LLM researchers to claim that LLMs must be somehow capable of doing some sort of reasoning since they are after all not doing the vanilla retrieval. 

This harks back to Sam Altman's famous ""For some definition of reasoning, LLMs do some kind of reasoning"" dictum (c.f. https://t.co/3lEi1N5tXP). 

There are obvious problems with this stance. 

To begin with, no one ever said that LLMs just do retrieval (in fact, having been trained to be a type of n-gram models, they can't actually do exact retrieval by default!). 

Anyone who ever played with LLMs from GPT3 on know that their appeal is that they don't do exact retrieval.

They do some generative version of retrieval that I have called ""approximate retrieval"" (and tried to pin it down a bit more firmly here: https://t.co/qMJxiOCeRa). 

If you visualize retrieval and reasoning as two points on a linear spectrum, approximate retrieval is different both from retrieval and reasoning. 

It is crucial to note that it differs from both retrieval and reasoning. The fact that it is different from retrieval can't thus be  used as some kind of proof that it must be doing reasoning! . The fortuitous intersection between approximate retrieval and reasoning is so uneven as to lead to popularization of phrases like jagged intelligence (https://t.co/yu92679hXA)

Indeed the implicit hypothesis that mere scale-up of autoregressive LLMs will magically convert their approximate retrieval to (sound) reasoning has been tested with considerable expense from GPT3 on--and has so far not yielded any fruit. If anything, more studies have established the limitations of autoregressive LLMs in reasoning tasks (I guess we were just doing it way before it was cool https://t.co/ftKyGsAFl4 üòÑ)

This is becoming common-enough knowledge now that major vendors are slowly shifting to adding actual reasoning components on top of autoregressive LLMs--despite  the stone soup ironies some of those approaches (see https://t.co/tKWJEWmoSt).

tldr; you can't claim that LLMs must be doing reasoning just because they are not doing retrieval--the law of excluded middle doesn't quite apply! 

If you want to do a better/more formal characterization of their approximate retrieval--that would be a great research direction.",0,44,0

If you are on the right, I want you to open your mind and realize that no matter what problems you have with the left, Robert F Kennedy is a uniquely sinister figure who should have no role in public life. Here's just one example as to why.

RFK wrote the foreword for a book by an anti-vaxx organization he once led that claimed to list young people dropping dead from the covid vaccine. The 12-year-old boy on the cover hadn't even been vaccinated against covid. He was just a random kid who died for unrelated reasons, anti-vaxxers put him on the cover of a book, and RFK promoted it. 

When the family tried to tell them about this, the publisher ignored them.

The AP reports: 

When 12-year-old Braden Fahey collapsed during football practice and died, it was just the beginning of his parents‚Äô nightmare.

Deep in their grief a few months later, Gina and Padrig Fahey received news that shocked them to their core: A favorite photo of their beloved son was plastered on the cover of a book that falsely argues COVID-19 vaccines caused a spike of sudden deaths among healthy young people.

The book, called ‚ÄúCause Unknown,‚Äù was co-published by an anti-vaccine group led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs nephew, who is now running for president. Kennedy wrote the foreword and promoted the book, tweeting that it details data showing ‚Äú COVID shots are a crime against humanity.‚Äù

The Faheys couldn‚Äôt understand how Braden‚Äôs face appeared on the book‚Äôs cover, or why his name appeared inside it.

Braden never received the vaccine. His death in August 2022 was due to a malformed blood vessel in his brain. No one ever contacted them to ask about their son‚Äôs death, or for permission to use the photo. No one asked to confirm the date of his death ‚Äî which the book misdated by a year. When the Faheys and residents of their town in California tried to contact the publisher and author to get Braden and his picture taken out of the book, no one responded.

They finally took the boy off the cover of the book after it became a story during Kennedy's 2024 run. Kennedy supporters have harassed the boy's parents, maybe because they believe they're lying about the covid vaccine and part of the conspiracy. 

12-year-old Branden Fahey isn't the only person they were lying about. They were just taking random people who died and made a book about them. One even died in 2019, before covid vaccines were invented.

The AP found dozens of individuals included in the book died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.

AP asked Kennedy‚Äôs campaign, CHD, Dowd and Skyhorse president Tony Lyons several questions about the book, including why they chose to feature Braden, why they didn‚Äôt speak to his family first and what steps they took to fact check.

Kennedy's former organization says that Fahey's obituary didn't list a cause of death, so they just decided to take his picture and put it on the cover of their anti-vaxx book. I'm serious. This is how anti-vaxxers reason. ""Maybe your son who died in 2019 actually died because he was vaxxed? Just asking questions! Why are you afraid of debate? What are you hiding?""

In emails, Lyons did not address why Braden specifically was chosen for the cover but defended his inclusion by saying that news stories and his obituary did not mention his cause of death.

Hundreds of deaths are cited in the book, though Lyons said it only attributes nine of them to the vaccine. Lyons said Braden‚Äôs death and others are never explicitly attributed to the vaccine, and that the book explores many possible reasons for deaths that have appeared in headlines since 2021.

Still, the book several times refers to its ‚Äúthesis‚Äù that mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines caused a spike in deaths. Braden‚Äôs parents said his appearance in the context of the book implies he died of the vaccine, putting his death in a false light.

Anti-vaxxers are very dedicated and put out a lot of material. People see this and assume that there must be something to what they're saying. How can they produce so many books, papers, and podcasts if vaccines are safe? What's wrong with opening up a debate?

You'll never have the time to go through all of their claims. The thing to realize is that these are some of the stupidest and most dishonest people in public life. They've been shunned from mainstream institutions for good reason, and it's a troubling sign that they're now being given political power. 

If you think elites are the problem, know that they at least want nothing to do with anti-vaxxers. I consider this a litmus test. The degree to which institutions reject these people can be taken as a direct measure of how well they're functioning.",0,391,0

AP asked Kennedy‚Äôs campaign, CHD, Dowd and Skyhorse president Tony Lyons several questions about the book, including why they chose to feature Braden, why they didn‚Äôt speak to his family first and what steps they took to fact check.

Kennedy's former organization says that Fahey's obituary didn't list a cause of death, so they just decided to take his picture and put it on the cover of their anti-vaxx book. I'm serious. This is how anti-vaxxers reason. ""Maybe your son who died in 2019 actually died because he was vaxxed? Just asking questions! Why are you afraid of debate? What are you hiding?""

In emails, Lyons did not address why Braden specifically was chosen for the cover but defended his inclusion by saying that news stories and his obituary did not mention his cause of death.

Hundreds of deaths are cited in the book, though Lyons said it only attributes nine of them to the vaccine. Lyons said Braden‚Äôs death and others are never explicitly attributed to the vaccine, and that the book explores many possible reasons for deaths that have appeared in headlines since 2021.

Still, the book several times refers to its ‚Äúthesis‚Äù that mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines caused a spike in deaths. Braden‚Äôs parents said his appearance in the context of the book implies he died of the vaccine, putting his death in a false light.

Anti-vaxxers are very dedicated and put out a lot of material. People see this and assume that there must be something to what they're saying. How can they produce so many books, papers, and podcasts if vaccines are safe? What's wrong with opening up a debate?

You'll never have the time to go through all of their claims. The thing to realize is that these are some of the stupidest and most dishonest people in public life. They've been shunned from mainstream institutions for good reason, and it's a troubling sign that they're now being given political power. 

If you think elites are the problem, know that they at least want nothing to do with anti-vaxxers. I consider this a litmus test. The degree to which institutions reject these people can be taken as a direct measure of how well they're functioning.",2239,391,104

Some skills can be fully genetically stored like motor skills of eg. a giraffe that is born and pretty much walks away within 30 seconds. For many intelligence domains, it is best to only have a good randomly initialized architecture / brain region that is plastic and can adapt to its environment like Brocca‚Äôs region for human languages.
Similar to the drunk that searches for keys only under the street light, we are only searching for architectures that work well on current GPUs. How many more outer loops do we need to run architecture search to find truly optimal models that can learn with less data?

I feel anxious and saddened by Trump‚Äôs election. Years of turmoil and uncertainty await us. I have also come to believe that this is not Trump‚Äôs win. It is the Democrats who have lost this election.
This is not because Biden stayed on as a candidate despite his age. It is not because Kamala Harris is not qualified (I believe she‚Äôs amply qualified). It is because of Democrats‚Äô campaign. Dems have been losing the American workers and did nothing to regain them in this election.
Dems have ceased to be the workers‚Äô party long ago, owing to their support for digital disruption, globalization, large immigrant flows, and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù ideas.

For a while it looked like Dems could still win elections with support from Silicon Valley, minorities, some portions of organized labor and the professional class in large cities. But this was never a healthy coalition, and even organized labor wasn‚Äôt going to remain faithful for long.
This coalition made Dems increasingly alienated from workers and the middle class in much of the country, especially in smaller cities and the South.
The message was loud and clear in 2016, and all of the soul-searching that followed was healthy. It was part of the reason why Biden adopted a pro-worker industrial strategy.
Biden‚Äôs economy delivered for the working class in terms of jobs and strengthening the industrial base of the country. Wages at the bottom rose rapidly. Policy started moving towards the views of the American workers on immigration, protectionism, support for unions and public investment.
And yet, I fear that Dem activists and the establishment never fully internalized the woes of the workers and never made enough of an effort to bring them back to the fold. They sounded distant and detached.
My test is the following: if stranded in an unknown city, would a Dem elite (typically a professional or bureaucrat from a coastal city, with postgraduate education) prefer to spend the next four hours talking to an American worker with a high school degree from the Midwest?
Or would he or she prefer to spend it with a professional with postgraduate education from Mexico, China or Indonesia? Or name your country? I asked this question to colleagues and friends, they all think is the latter --- as do I. Most Dem elites are now alienated from American workers.
It seemed at first that Harris-Walz may try to change that, emphasizing bolstering up the middle class and patriotism, in an effort to appeal to the working class deserting the party. A true effort in that direction would have been commendable, and if credible, perhaps win the election.
But at the end, the campaign focused on abortion and other issues appealing to the base. The main effort to broaden the base came from using Liz Cheney to appeal to suburban women ¬≠--- on abortion.
Of course, abortion is a critical issue. But focusing on it was never going to win the working class, and certainly not the working-class men.
On the economy, Dems can talk about opportunity and jobs (which they need to do). But they never distanced themselves from the Silicon Valley and the global business elite (but ironically, Silicon Valley started leaving them!)
I fear that, now, Trump and Vance‚Äôs Republican Party will be the main home for workers, especially manufacturing workers and those in smaller cities.

We conduct a systematic study to answer this question by investigating whether a video gen model is able to learn physical laws. 

Three are three key messages to take home: 
1‚É£The model generalises perfectly for in-distribution data, but fails to do out-of-distribution generalization. For combinatorial scenarios, scaling law is observed. 

2‚É£The models fail to abstract general rules and instead tries to mimic the closest training example.

3‚É£The model prioritizes different attributes when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape.

The paper leaves these important measurements out of the abstract, instead emphasizing much less informative once-a-week / once-a-month numbers.

This work is another important step towards our goal of achieving Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI).

What we‚Äôre releasing:
‚Ä¢ Meta Spirit LM: An open source language model for seamless speech and text integration.
‚Ä¢¬†Meta Segment Anything Model 2.1: An updated checkpoint with improved results on visually similar objects, small objects and occlusion handling. Plus a new developer suite to make it easier for developers to build with SAM 2.
‚Ä¢¬†Layer Skip: Inference code and fine-tuned checkpoints demonstrating a new method for enhancing LLM performance.
‚Ä¢¬†SALSA: New code to enable researchers to benchmark AI-based attacks in support of validating security for post-quantum cryptography.
‚Ä¢¬†Meta Lingua: A lightweight and self-contained codebase designed to train language models at scale.
‚Ä¢¬†Meta Open Materials: New open source models and the largest dataset of its kind to accelerate AI-driven discovery of new inorganic materials.
‚Ä¢¬†MEXMA: A new research paper and code for our novel pre-trained cross-lingual sentence encoder with coverage across 80 languages.
‚Ä¢ Self-Taught Evaluator: a new method for generating synthetic preference data to train reward models without relying on human annotations.

Access to state-of-the-art AI creates opportunities for everyone. We‚Äôre excited to share this work and look forward to seeing the community innovation that results from it.

An important point is that the emergence of AI is not some sort of natural phenomenon that we have to protect against

Artificial intelligence is different. It's past the point where a difference in degree becomes a difference in kind. AI amplifies and multiplies the human brain, much like steam engines once amplified muscle power. Before engines, we consumed food for energy and that energy we put to work. Engines allowed us to tap into external energy sources like coal and oil, revolutionizing productivity and transforming society. AI stands poised to be the intellectual parallel, offering a near-infinite expansion of brainpower to serve humanity.

AI promises a future of unparalleled abundance. However, as we transition to a post-scarcity society, the journey may be complex, and the short term may be painful for those displaced. Mitigating these challenges requires well-reasoned policy. The next 0‚Äì10 years, 10‚Äì25 years, and 25‚Äì50 years will each be radically different. The pace of change will be hard to predict or anticipate, especially as technology capabilities far exceed human intelligence and penetrate society at varying rates. (1/25)

2024-10-13 23:41:12+00:00,"RT @rao2z: On the Stone Soup of LLM Reasoning  #SundayHarangue 

Stone soup is the European folk story where some clever travelers convince the gullible locals that they are making delicious soup with a stone--and they do need a few things to ""improve its flavor""--such as carrots, potatoes, onions, butter etc.. 

There is nothing ipso facto wrong with Stone Soup--it is, after all, soup! It may even be delicious! The question instead is how much credit should the stone get for the soup's delciousness.

The version of Stone Soup in AGI/AI circles are claims that LLMs can reason and plan--with just a few things to ""improve the flavor"". 

These needed things needed can range from external tools/verifiers etc (as in LLM-Modulo), to tacking on search on top of LLMs (the tree of thoughts), to tacking on a Mu_zero/Alpha_go like RL component that influences pretraining as well as inference stage (the üçì o1 model; see https://t.co/5nivQhAXFB). The question is whether the ""augmented"" systems are LLMs or some other qualitatively different beasts better called LRMs (cf. https://t.co/CvHuWhlKNj). 

Although it has become fashionable to equate LLMs to AI, and ask  ""When will AI Reason?""--the fact of the matter is that we have always had AI systems--planning, RL etc.--capable of reasoning. It can be argued that much of AI before LLMs was in fact was deep and narrow System 2 approximators (and thus https://t.co/m0Ecnvnx6E and https://t.co/NcZaqR2QzH). 

The appeal of LLMs is that they are the first effective System 1 approximators that AI managed to develop (c.f. https://t.co/UsnxSYaeKU). 

There have been several attempts to get System 2 reasoning behaviors from LLMs while keeping their essential autoregressive System 1 nature intact. These early attempts--such as ""fine tuning"", ""Chain of thought"" etc.--have by now been shown to be deeply flawed (c.f. https://t.co/DEjF9gLR8q & https://t.co/NE0MizcWN7). In other words, no soup from them!  #Seinfeld 

In contrast, the approaches that tack on search/RL etc. at the inference stage seem to be more promising (c.f  https://t.co/RqRf4fWjrU). But these ""compound"" LRM systems are no longer autoregressive LLMs and don't have any ""start completing the prompt as soon you hit return"" characteristic that is such a big part of LLM popularity!

In particular, if the LRM is taking indefinite and costly inference time compute, the right comparison will be to other System 2 AI approaches that incur such inference time costs.  Such considerations bring some of the traditional CS analyses--all but forgotten when online computation was given up for dead (c.f. https://t.co/I9Ya3j2EER)--back into play (see https://t.co/RqRf4fWjrU & https://t.co/JeZ8L0ryia). 

Interestingly, you can also err assuming that LRMs will  inherit all the limitations of LLMs (something that the analyses that clump, for example, o1 with autoregressive LLMs mistakenly make).. They don't!  Stone Soup is more than Stone--even if it may not be the best way to make soup!  

Specifically, many of the common critiques of LLM reasoning capabilities don't directly apply to LRMs. Not recognizing this and adding LRMs like o1 as yet another entry in a table brimming with autoregressive LLMs confuses the message.  (For example, if you look at the appendix of that latest Apple study on LLM reasoning, you will see that o1 does quite fine--accuracy-wise--on their instances with irrelevant information.)

the illusion LLMs are intelligent comes from their massive scale. it is hard to visualize, but these things memorized the WHOLE internet. everything you've ever asked it, either has been solved before, or is a simple combination of existing solutions. but that's still an illusion.

when LLMs face a problem that require a NEW solution - one of original shape, one it has never seen before - they fail. it is that simple. that's what my example shows. i took as simple problem - inverting a binary tree - and added a few constraints to make sure the solution is unique and not in the dataset, forcing it to actually SOLVE it itself. and, surprise - it can't!

and I must stress this isn't about THIS problem. but about all. LLMs can't solve ANY problem, at all. it can only spit a memorized solution. if nobody posts this solution online, not even GPT-6, opus-5, or o3, will be able to solve *this very prompt*. I'm betting on that.

the inability to create new solutions imply LLMs won't invent new science. yes, they will completely change the world as we know it. they'll have a higher impact than computers and the internet. but, unless a new kind AI emerges, we're still on our own when it comes to curing cancer or making superconductors.",2886,376,151

This short course is created with @Meta and taught by @asangani7, Director of AI Partner Engineering at Meta.

Meta‚Äôs Llama family of models is leading the way in open models, allowing anyone to download, customize, fine-tune, or build new applications on top of them.

Learn about the vision capabilities of the Llama 3.2, and use it for image classification, prompting, tokenization, tool-calling. You'll also learn about the open-source Llama stack, which gives building blocks for many different stages of the LLM application life cycle.

In detail, you‚Äôll:
- Learn what are the features of Meta's four newest models, and when to use which Llama model.
- Learn best practices for multimodal prompting, with applications to advanced image reasoning, illustrated by many examples: Understanding errors on a car dashboard, adding up the total of photographed restaurant receipts, grading written math homework.
- Use different roles‚Äîsystem, user, assistant, ipython‚Äîin the Llama 3.1 and 3.2 models  and the prompt format that identifies those roles.
- Understand how Llama uses the tiktoken tokenizer, and how it has expanded to a 128k vocabulary size that improves encoding efficiency and multilingual support.
- Learn how to prompt Llama to call built-in and custom tools (functions) with examples for web search and solving math equations.
- Learn about Llama Stack, a standardized interface for common toolchain components like fine-tuning or synthetic data generation, useful for building agentic applications.

By the end of this course, you‚Äôll be equipped to build out new applications with the new Llama 3.2.

Thank you to @Ahmad_Al_Dahle, Amit Sangani, and the whole AI at Meta team @AIatMeta for all the hard work on Llama 3.2 ‚Äî we‚Äôre excited to make these open models even more accessible to more developers with this new course!

You see these MAGA accounts claiming that volunteers are being blocked from delivering supplies. Yes, this is true in some cases‚Äîbut here‚Äôs what they aren‚Äôt telling you:

When a natural disaster hits, it triggers a coordinated series of events led by FEMA and other agencies. The initial priority is rescue operations, focused on saving lives and reaching those in immediate danger. This phase requires clear, unimpeded access for first responders to do their jobs efficiently.

Next comes infrastructure assessments. Civil engineers, contractors, and local authorities are deployed to inspect roads, bridges, and buildings. Their goal is to determine whether these structures are safe for travel. In many instances where volunteers have been stopped or redirected, it‚Äôs because these assessments were still in progress, or it was deemed unsafe to allow additional traffic into the area.

Volunteers play a crucial role in disaster recovery, but uncoordinated or premature efforts can actually do more harm than good. Imagine volunteers crossing a bridge that engineers haven‚Äôt cleared, and it collapses. Not only would that create another emergency, but it would divert critical resources and personnel away from those in desperate need of help.

If you hear that FEMA is blocking volunteers, understand this: it‚Äôs often a necessary precaution to protect both volunteers and the communities they are trying to serve. Once areas are deemed safe, volunteer efforts are welcomed and coordinated to ensure the most effective use of resources.

FWIW:

SA:  ""You wouldn't know if a postal worker discarded mail-in ballots from a Red zip code.""

SR:  Yes you would.  People can track their ballots to see if they get back to tabulation center.  And if an entire precinct didn't vote, the jurisdiction would investigate.  It would look really weird on the partisan density maps (that you see on all the television networks) if all the sudden there was just a big whole.

SA:  ""You wouldn't know if the millions of overseas ballots that require no identification are even cast by Americans.""

SR:  Military and overseas ballots require identification verification, just like other mail ballots. For example, we do signature verification on these return ballot packets.  And there aren't ""millions of overseas ballots"" even across all 50 states.  There were approximately 890,000 military and overseas votes in the 2020 general election.  Across the WHOLE COUNTRY.

SA:  ""You wouldn't know if a state actor and an insider accomplice hacked voting systems.""

SR:  I'm not sure what you mean by ""voting system,"" but if you mean ballot tabulation systems, then almost all states do post-election tests of tabulation equipment.  This often includes a post-election hand count audit performed by the political parties to make sure that tabulators accurately read the ballots.  It also ignores that tabulation systems are under lock and key and 24/7 video surveillance and usually have other physical security impediments.  Additionally, the software is typically state and federally certified and isn't as manipulable as simply rewriting a line of open access C++ code.

SA:  ""You wouldn't know if someone printed fake ballots and inserted them into the process.""

SR:  If a voter votes in person, he is given one ballot that is specially designed to be compatible with the tabulator.  The voter marks his ballot and then feeds the ballot into the tabulator himself.

If a voter votes by mail ballot, the ballot must come back in a return envelope that is linked to a particular voter through a barcode.  Election offices don't accept loose ballots dropped off at the doorstep.  That barcode ensures that each voter only votes once.  Once the return mail envelope is verified, bipartisan teams remove the ballot from the envelope, and they keep a log of the number of batches in ballots.  When it goes to tabulation, the number of ballots read by the tabulator needs to match the number of ballots in the batch according to the log.  This process is done by bipartisan workers and overseen by partisan observers.

SA:  ""You wouldn't know the extent of ballot harvesting in states where it is illegal.""

SR:  I agree that small scale ballot harvesting is exceptionally hard to police.  For example, if your neighbors fill out their ballots, put them in their return envelopes, sign their return envelopes, then give them to you, and then you drop them off at the USPS two weeks before the election, then that is ballot harvesting according to many state laws, and it is very hard to police.

That being said, if you started knocking on every door in your neighborhood, even the doors of the neighbors you don't know, and saying ""hey, give me your ballot,"" then I find it hard to believe that none of these neighbors would call the police or an election office.

If you tried to steal a whole bunch of ballot packets out of the mail, you'd also have to come up with decent imitations of the voter's signature, and I find it hard to believe that a whole bunch of voters would say nothing about their ballots not arriving in the mail.  As soon as the intended voter says anything, the original ballot packet would be cancelled, and a new one would be sent to a voter.  If this happened to an entire neighborhood, it would be investigated.

Our national brainwashers are so talented they made most Democrats believe we can know who won a national election in America.

Our election systems are designed to make it impossible to know who won. Our brainwashers tell us the opposite. 

Democrats have been brainwashed to believe the court system can resolve claims of cheating that can't be detected by anyone, including election observers. 

You wouldn't know if a postal worker discarded mail-in ballots from a Red zip code.

1. He knew he was losing 3 days prior to the election when his data analysis team reported to the campaign that the in person day of voting was not going to overcome the deficit they had in mail in voting. There were simply not enough votes available in the specific states to make it happen.

2. During that October 31 meeting it was decided that if the vote was close at 11pm Trump would come out and call it stolen in an attempt to force legal challenges that would allow him to stay in power.

3. In the days after the election his data analysis team told him the loss was legitimate. His campaign told him his loss was legitimate. His legal team told him his loss was legitimate. His FBI told him his loss was legitimate.

4. Rather than accepting the loss he cooked up this alternate elector scheme to try to steal the election. It was so crazy that most of his legal staff quit over it. Across multiple states his campaign illegally formed alternate slates of electors and attempted to get their votes counted instead of the real ones on Jan 6. Most if not all of the Republicans that made up these alternate electors had no idea they were doing anything illegal and were deceived by the Trump campaign. Many have been since charged with felonies.

5. After the election he was presented with the option to blanket pardon the J6ers but he was told he would very likely be impeached and convicted if he did so. Thus he would not be able to run for President again. He chose his political career over the lives of his supporters that he lied to in order to get them out to DC on J6.

All of this stuff is out there if you want to read about it. I've posted about it many times in the past. This is why I will never vote for Trump again.",3250,1052,176

2024-10-03 00:31:47+00:00,"RT @soumithchintala: There's three parts. 

1. Fitting as large of a network and as large of a batch-size as possible onto the 10k/100k/1m H100s --  parallelizing and using memory-saving tricks.
2. Communicating state between these GPUs as quickly as possible
3. Recovering from failures (hardware, software, etc.) as quickly as possible

1. Fitting as large of a network and as large of a batch-size as possible onto the 10k H100s.

Parallelizing:
1. parallelize over batches
2. parallelize over layers (i.e. split a layer across GPUs)
3. parallelize across layers (i.e. 1 to N are on GPU1, N+1th layer to N+10th layer are on GPU2)
Keep parallelizing until you are able to use all GPUs well, with maximum utilization.

Checkpointing / Compute vs memorize:
* You need to save certain terms from forward to compute the backprop (save_for_backward). However, if the network is sufficiently large, it is more profitable to free these terms in order to fit a larger batch-size, and recompute them again when you need them to compute the backprop.
* Tricks like FSDP discard parts of weights that are held in one GPU (to save memory), and ask for the shards of weights from other GPUs right before they need them.

2. Communicating state between these GPUs as quickly as possible

Communication overlap:
When you need to communicate among GPUs, try to start communication as soon as you can:
* Exampel: when Nth layer is done with backward, while N-1th layer is computing backward, all GPUs with an Nth layer can all-reduce their gradients)

Discover and leverage the underlying networking topology:

Communicating large amounts of state (gradients, optimizer state) across multiple nodes is complicated. with Sync SGD, you have to communicate this state in a burst, as quickly as you can.

we might have multiple layers of switches, and have RDMA (ability to copy GPU memory directly to NIC, bypassing CPU ram entirely), and have frontend and backend NICs (frontend connects to storage like NFS, backend connects GPUs to other GPUs in cluster).

So, it's important to leverage all this info when running communication collectives like all-reduce or scatter/gather. All-reduce for example can be done algorithmically in log(n) if you tree-reduce; and the constant factors that change based on the type of fiber connecting one node to another in the tree of networking fiber is important to reduce overall time and latency.

Libraries like NCCL do sophisticated discovery of the underlying networking topology and leverage them when we run all-reduce and other collectives.

3. Recovering from failures (hardware, software, etc.) as quickly as possible

At 10k GPU scale, things fail all the time -- GPUs, NICs, cables, etc. Some of these failures are easy to detect quickly, some of them you can only detect because one node isn't replying back in time (say a NCCL all-reduce is stuck). We build various tools to monitor and detect fleet health, and remove failed nodes from the fleet as quickly as possible. This is quite hard.

Separately, at this large of a scale you can have silent data corruptions from memory bits flipping randomly (due to basic physics and amplifying the probability at this scale), and you suddenly have loss-explosions for no reason other than this random phenomenon. These happen at small-scale too, but very very infrequently so you barely notice. This is very hard to detect before-hand in software. Some hardware has hardware circuitry that does built-in checksums after it computes things -- this way if bit-flips occur the hardware can throw an interrupt. H100s and previous NVIDIA GPUs don't have this feature.

To counter all these failures, you would want to save your model state as frequently and as quickly as you can; and when a failure occurs, you want to recover and continue as quickly as you can. Usually, we save model state really quickly to CPU memory in a separate thread and in the background we save from CPU memory to disk or remote storage.
We also save model state in shards (this is torch.distributed's checkpointing feature), i.e. not every GPU needs to save all of the model weights; each GPU only needs to save a portion of weights -- and they can recover the other part of weights from other GPU shard checkpoints.",0,178,0

Economic growth is rip-roaring, with real GDP up 3% over the past year. Unemployment is low at near 4%, consistent with full employment. Inflation is fast closing in on Fed‚Äôs 2% target - grocery prices, rents and gas prices are flat to down over the past more than a year.  Households‚Äô financial obligations are light, and set to get lighter with the Fed cutting rates. House prices have never been higher, and most homeowners have more equity in their homes than ever. Corporate profits are robust, and the stock market is hitting a record high on a seemingly daily basis. Of course there are blemishes, as lower-income households are struggling financially, there is a severe shortage of affordable homes, and the government is running large budget deficits. And things could change quickly. There are plenty of threats. But in my time as an economist, the economy has rarely looked better.",29804,11509,4132

The numbers were mostly between 1 and 1.5 million per year between the mid-1980s and the mid-2000s.
They came down in the late 2000s and were low under Obama (<500k/y).
They started picking up in 2019 (under Trump), but came down in 2020 because of Covid.
In 2020, Trump invoked ""Title 42"" (public health) to expulse people.
Then, the increase of influx resumed in 2021. 
Biden also used Title 42 to expulse people in increasing numbers.
There were no ""open borders policy"": Biden actually expulsed way more people than anyone before him.
Influx increased because things were bad in some Latin American countries, and more people wanted out and showed up at the border.
Biden kept increasing the number of expulsions to keep the influx within the same level as the late 1990s.
Title 42 expired in mid-2023, and expulsions had to be replaced by ""inadmissible"" status.
But the month-by-month chart clearly shows that the numbers are coming down.

2024-09-26 13:45:54+00:00,"I find it so interesting (and smart) that Meta / LLaMA is eliminating the dependence of their models on the HuggingFace stack.

The LLaMA models now:
- Have their own website to download weights.
- Have one of the best LLM cookbooks that's available.
- Provide extensive documentation / tutorials.
- Can be finetuned easily via torchtune.
- Have several hosting / deployment frameworks (ExecuTorch, TorchChat, OLLaMA, etc).
- Are portable to numerous different environments and application setups (RAG, agents, etc.) via LLaMAStack.

The open-source language model landscape has been tightly coupled with HuggingFace for a long time. Personally, I've used HuggingFace for nearly every project I've worked on since ~2018 (back in the pytorch-pretrained-bert days!). I still think HuggingFace is an incredibly useful tool, but this competition is valuable. It forces everyone to build better-and more user friendly-software.

Why is this important? Research and development in the AI space has always followed and been accelerated by the available tooling and resources. For example:
- ImageNet propelled computer vision for years.
- PyTorch drastically accelerated and democratized deep learning research via its simplicity.
- HuggingFace made downloading and finetuning (L)LMs incredibly simple, encouraging research / participation over the last 6 years.

If we have easy to use tools and many resources available, more people will participate, more ideas will be proposed, and the field will generally evolve faster! 

The LLaMA ecosystem seems to be becoming the new standard. It's so extensive that, similarly to HuggingFace in 2018-2020, it is becoming difficult to release a successful model that is not compatible with LLaMA software tools. It's not just the models / weights that are important, the tooling is a moat of its own!",1245,153,19

This has happened repeatedly in the history of humanity. Imagine telling someone 1000 years ago that in the future, very few people would actually work in agriculture.

It's available on the shelf of well-stocked booksellers, and I wrote it to be accessible to as large audience as possible; it's not really a technical book, even though it tackles some technical topics. I started working on this book about two years ago, and much has happened in the AI space since then. Still, I think it holds up well.

One of the main points is that artificial general intelligence is a confused and confusing idea, largely because we don't know what either intelligence or generality means. We keep making impressive progress in AI technology - and I try to explain some key AI methods, such as LLMs, in simple terms - but the various AI methods have different upsides and downsides, and we are far from having a single system that can do everything we think of as needing ""intelligence"". Clearly, the future of AI has room for many perspectives and different technical approaches. The book also discusses what more progress in AI could mean for society, and draws on science fiction to paint contrasting visions of what AGI might mean.

This has been a passion project of mine that I ended up using much of my sabbatical on. I'm an optimist, and I argue for open access to knowledge and technology, and against undue regulations. If I can achieve anything with this book, I hope that it will be to explain some of the wonderful possibilities of this technology to people, as it is natural to be afraid of things you don't understand.",0,172,0

Upheavals in various countries are causing lots of migrants to leave their home and attempt to enter the US.
You have nothing to do with this surge. 
It's just happening because of events abroad.
You are in charge and must deal with it, 
What would you do with these people?

1. Half of them of them don't just cross the border. They come in *legally* on a tourist visa or temporary worker visa and overstay their visa. That represents almost half of illegal immigration in the US. You were one of those once, and so were many of our friends in tech.

2. A number of them seek asylum. The US is bound by international treaties as to how to handle asylum seekers. You have to examine their case one by one and grant asylum to many of them. You don't have much choice in the matter. In the meantime, you have to find housing and work for these folks. You can't just let them live on the streets with their kids and starve.

3. Many of them will just attempt to cross the long southern border without going through a border checkpoint. They might have applied for a visa or refugee status but didn't get it. Their choice is to stay in their home country and risk starvation or death, or take a smaller risk crossing the border. You could try to simply ""close the border."" But it's a very long border, and unless you have enough troops and holding facilities, you can't just catch everyone and keep them in concentration camps. It would cost a veritable fortune to do so, way more than letting these folks live and work as undocumented immigrants. It would also be a humanitarian nightmare. You would be running modern-day concentration camps. 

What would *you* do with all these people then?
Before deporting them abroad, you would need to get agreements from the destination countries. 
Will those countries agree to hold lots of folks in refugee camps?
Are you going to help them cover the expense?
The public opinion and the courts will limit how inhumane you can be.

What's would be your solution?

2024-09-21 02:04:49+00:00,"i've been going on and on about this, but basically, AI flips electricity on its head.

previously, nearly half the cost of electricity to the consumer was allocated towards distributing it where (and when) you want it. 

AI data centers want upwards of hundreds of megawatts of power in one place, most of the time. (and for training they don't care about latency)

The most constrained thing isn't even the energy itself -- there's a surplus during the solar peak -- it's often the sheer availability & the interconnection. It now can take multiple years to get a grid interconnect to draw power of this magnitude, if the location can even handle it.

The capital cost of the power infrastructure is just a tiny fraction (like 3%!) of the capex of the compute, and even just the depreciation of the compute exceeds the cost of even premium power.

Hence, AI hyperscalers and those that aspire to be in their class are traveling to where the power is, are building where power has been (and there's legacy transmission to support it, like old nuclear plants) and are getting into the business of actually building powerplants and reactors.

Utilities and transmission and distribution companies, interconnection queues, all are used to react much slower -- over many years -- unlike the top technology companies, now vying to compete at the highest levels of AI performance. 

Since ~99% of energy technologies previously died withering while waiting for utilities to consider them bankable, this represents an extremely fertile, attractive new state of play if you're bringing a new energy technology to market (üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîÜ).

- Engineered Geothermal
- Fusion!

Were  definite proof, but pretty strong evidence.

The whole point of the scientific method is to mimimize the effect of human cognitive biases, preconceived ideas, and prejudice.
Scientists make a hypothesis, then collect data to constitute evidence for whether the hypothesis is true or false.
One reason for the peer review process in science is to identify methodological flaws in a piece of work. A major characteristic of the process of science is to systematically question claims and see if results can be reproduced or not by different groups than the original authors.

The history of science is replete with experiments whose results showed the opposite of what the scientists set out to establish.

An example?
The 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to show the existence of the luminiferous aether by measuring differences in the speed of light in various directions due to the motion of the earth. Instead, it showed that the speed of light was constant and independent of the motion of the observer.

Their hate speech sews division, causes harm, and incites some of the more brainwashed followers to commit crimes motivated by hate.

The 1st Amendment protects most types of speech but does *not* protect ""incitement."" 
People who are directly hurt by an incitement to violence can sue the perpetrator. The threat of lawsuits is the only thing that stops hate speech perpetrators from going too far (that's why Trump was advised to take down his hateful tweet against Taylor Swift).

In the US, the boundary of what constitutes incitement or not has been decided by the courts. 
But the point is this: Some types of hate speech are illegal in the US *despite* the 1st Amendment.

Most of Europe has enshrined definitions of hate speech into law, rather than leaving it up to the courts.

But let's not pretend that the US has unfettered free speech while Europe has ""tyrannical"" restrictions on it.

Note: this does not apply to AI, Machine Learning, and most of computer science, where publication venues are open access and free for readers and authors. Almost all papers are posted on ArXiv first, which gives early open access to everyone. This greatly accelerates the dissemination of new ideas and explains in part why AI has been progressing so fast in the last 15 years (until some industry players decided to clam up, like OpenAI and to some extent Google & DeepMind). (ArXiv is largely supported by the Simons Foundation).

Conferences and journals (like JMLR and TMLR) don't need much money to operate since they use unpaid volunteers as editors, formatting is done by authors, and web hosting is cheap. Most venues use https://t.co/6fdNM7krae for the reviewing process (OpenReview is funded by donations from conferences, workshops, companies, and foundations).. Operating funds come from registration fees to conferences and donations. Conferences are run by non-profits (e.g. in ML, the ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML foundations. In CV, the Computer Vision Foundation). 

There are a few closed-access and/or for-profit outlets that some authors insist on using (still), e.g. Nature Machine Intelligence (essentially a DeepMind vassal), some IEEE conferences and journals (IEEE is non-profit but insists on charging for access to publications), and most ACM conferences and journals (ACM is non-profit but charges authors $1000 to $1800 to make their papers open access).",1270,184,43

Unless one uses a preventive mechanism, training joint embedding architectures with SSL leads to a collapse: the representation learned by the system is uninformative, or even constant.
A number of methods have been devised to prevent this collapse. 
One class of methods is sample-contrastive: ensure that different inputs produce different representations.
Another class is dimension-contrastive: ensure that different variables of the representation encode different aspects of the input.
Both types of methods can be derived from information maximization arguments: make sure the representation encodes as much information as possible about the input.
Variance-Covariance Regularization, MMCR, and MCR2 (from Yi Ma's group at Berkeley) are all infomax dimension-contrastive methods. They push the encoder to learn representations of the input that fill up the representation space as much as possible.

2024-09-10 20:19:50+00:00,Good list of juicy parts from Mario Draghi's report to the EU Commission on growth and innovation.,186,17,34
2024-09-09 12:59:04+00:00,"Mario Draghi's new report on EU competitiveness doesn't mince words.

""Across different metrics, a wide gap in GDP has opened up between the EU and the US, driven mainly by a more pronounced slowdown in productivity growth in Europe. Europe‚Äôs households have paid the price in foregone living standards. On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000.""

""First ‚Äì and most importantly ‚Äì Europe must profoundly refocus its collective efforts on closing the innovation gap with the US and China, especially in advanced technologies. Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, there is no EU company with a market capitalisation over EUR 100 billion that has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years, while all six US companies with a valuation above EUR 1 trillion have been created in this period. This lack of dynamism is self-fulfilling.""

""There are not enough academic institutions achieving top levels of excellence and the pipeline from innovation into commercialisation is weak. [...] However, while the EU boasts a strong university system on average, not enough universities and research institutions are at the top. Using volume of publications in top academic science journals as an indicative metric, the EU has only three research institutions ranked among the top 50 globally, whereas the US has 21 and China 15.""

""Regulatory barriers to scaling up are particularly onerous in the tech sector, especially for young companies. Regulatory barriers constrain growth in several ways. First, complex and costly procedures across fragmented national systems discourage inventors from filing Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), hindering young companies from leveraging the Single Market. Second, the EU‚Äôs regulatory stance towards tech companies hampers innovation: the EU now has around 100 tech-focused laws and over 270 regulators active in digital networks across all Member States. Many EU laws take a precautionary approach, dictating specific business practices ex ante to avert potential risks ex post. For example, the AI Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on general purpose AI models that exceed a pre-defined threshold of computational power ‚Äì a threshold which some state-of-the-art models already exceed. Third, digital companies are deterred from doing business across the EU via subsidiaries, as they face heterogeneous requirements, a proliferation of regulatory agencies and ‚Äúgold plating‚Äù of EU legislation by national authorities. Fourth, limitations on data storing and processing create high compliance costs and hinder the creation of large, integrated data sets for training AI models. This fragmentation puts EU companies at a disadvantage relative to the US, which relies on the private sector to build vast data sets, and China, which can leverage its central institutions for data aggregation. This problem is compounded by EU competition enforcement possibly inhibiting intra-industry cooperation. Finally, multiple different national rules in public procurement generate high ongoing costs for cloud providers. The net effect of this burden of regulation is that only larger companies ‚Äì which are often non-EU based ‚Äì have the financial capacity and incentive to bear the costs of complying. Young innovative tech companies may choose not to operate in the EU at all.""

This is a lawsuit.  You're very familiar with them.  Lawsuits can allege anything.  An allegation is called an allegation because it has not be proven.

The mere filing of that lawsuit did not mean Tesla was liable for patent infringement.  As you know, Nikola could write their own ""facts"" and their own understanding of the law.

Sadly, these lawsuits are no longer interested in actually winning.  They're just PR stunts that masquerade as lawsuits.  They're great fundraising devices.  They get people fired up.  And then very few people actually check in and say ""wtf?"" when, eventually, the lawsuit fails.

2024-09-04 13:30:10+00:00,"A thread about what is wrong with the influence of Elon Musk and other tech billionaires. Another thread about content moderation will follow later this week.
Obviously, the problem isn‚Äôt that Musk is expressing his opinions, which is his freedom of speech. It isn‚Äôt that Musk has turned into a big supporter of Trump. It isn‚Äôt even that Musk is posting AI-generated fake images of Kamala Harris: https://t.co/1vprj7i0at
My concerns are more sociological and political economic.
My starting point is that in any society some individuals have more, much more power than others. Once upon a time, this may have been linked to physical strength or military prowess. Today, it is often related to what Simon Johnson and I called ‚Äúpersuasion power‚Äù in Power and Progress. 
https://t.co/NtJ8Ae60qr
Persuasion power is rooted in status or prestige: those with greater status can more easily persuade others. Where status comes from and how unequally it is distributed vary greatly across societies.
In the United States, status became linked to money and wealth, and income and wealth inequality skyrocketed. This meant a very steep status hierarchy.
That is problematic for several reasons.
First, status ‚Äì and relatedly persuasion power ‚Äì are largely zero-sum affairs. More status for somebody means less status for another. A steeper status hierarchy makes some people happy, and others unhappy and dissatisfied. Investment in zero-sum activities is often inefficient and excessive, as compared to investment in non-zero-sum activities. Compare, for example, the social value of spending money on pure gold multi-million-dollar Rolex watches versus spending time to learn some new skills. Both may have intrinsic values for the investors (due to the beauty of the watch and the pride of acquiring new knowledge). But, on the whole, the first type of investment signals that you are richer and more able to undertake conspicuous consumption, and it can easily get out of hand ‚Äì with people spending huge sums in order to edge ahead of others they see themselves in competition with. The second type of investment, on the other hand, increases your human capital also contributes to society. The first is largely zero-sum the second is largely non-zero-sum.
Second, there are evolutionary and social foundations for linking persuasion power to status and prestige ‚Äì it is individually rational to learn from people who have expertise and it is reasonable to link this expertise to success. This type of learning is also good for communities, because it enables them to coordinate on certain best practices.
https://t.co/sTx2LmvJNX
But when status gets linked to wealth and wealth inequality becomes very large, this social justification is lost. Consider the following thought experiment. Who has greater expertise on carpentry? A good, master carpenter or a hedge fund billionaire? If we think about it this way, we would probably conclude the former. But when wealth becomes status, we may start attaching more and more importance to views of hedge fund billionaires on carpentry. This example was purposefully simple and sharp. Let‚Äôs take another one to see why the ‚Äúwealth is status‚Äù social equilibrium is problematic. Whose views on freedom of speech you want to attach more importance to? A tech billionaire or a philosopher who has grappled with ethical questions related to the freedom of speech?
Third, even more problematic is the fact that in most societies, wealth inequality has an arbitrary dimension. Take Wilt Chamberlain and Lebron James. We may argue endlessly about which one is better, but clearly, they were both exceptionally talented basketball players. Chamberlain is estimated to have had a wealth of $10 million at the time of his death. Lebron James‚Äôs wealth today is estimated at $1.2 billion. These different outcomes are largely arbitrary. Chamberlain happened to live at a time when there were sports stars did not get compensated as much. This is partly about technology (everybody can watch Lebron James today), partly about norms (we‚Äôve have made it much more acceptable for people to be paid hundreds of millions of dollars), and partly about taxes (if the US today had the kinds of tax rates that it had in the 1950s, it would not generate such large wealth inequality). Similarly, if the tech sector did not become so central to the economy and did not have a winner-take-all aspect (which was also partly a choice of how we organize several markets and sectors), tech billionaires would not have become so rich. Bill Gates or Elon Musk are not any wiser because they are taxed less. But they have much more wealth because they are taxed so little. But then in a ‚Äúwealth is status‚Äù social equilibrium, their status and social influence multiplies because they are taxed so little.
Fourth, there is something even more pernicious which Simon Johnson and I explored in Power and Progress using the example of Ferdinand de Lesseps. In fact, we thought this was so important that we devoted the first full chapter, Chapter 2, of the book to it. Lesseps gained tremendous status in late 19th century France, coming to be identified as the ‚ÄúLe Grand Fran√ßais‚Äù (the great Frenchman), because of his success (and luck) in successfully completing the Suez Canal. He showed great skills in convincing politicians both in Egypt and France and some foresight in seeing that maritime international trade would become very important. He was also tremendously lucky in that his hopes that technological solutions to the way that he wanted to build the canal (without locks, which was initially impossible because of the amount of digging excavation that would be necessary) were developed just-in-time to save the project. But then what did Lesseps do with this prestige? He became reckless, unhinged and cocky, pushing the Panama Canal project in an unworkable direction, which ultimately led to the deaths of more than 20,000 people and to financial ruin for many more (including his own family). Persuasion power also makes you unrestrained, which can be socially dangerous and disruptive. Simon and I thought that Lesseps‚Äôs story was relevant precisely because the same dynamics were being played out with many tech leaders today.
Fifth, some very rich people choose not to use the status conferred on them by their wealth to centrally influence critical debates (think of Warren Buffett). Some like Bill Gates or Elon Musk do. It follows as a corollary of what I have argued so far that this is not desirable, because their status is excessive, and they are now influencing key social choices beyond their expertise. It is not tech billionaires‚Äô fault that US policy is fueling massive inequality (though they benefit from it handsomely and many of them then use their status in order to keep taxes low and regulations light).

2024-08-31 15:29:23+00:00,"Who are ""the elites"" we hear so much about?
One could say that the elites are people with power or influence.
They come in several flavors.

1. They can have intellectual influence because lots of people like their intellectual production. They so,etimes rose through the ranks of academia, arts, or science thanks to their intellectual production as judged by their peers and mentors, or the appreciation of the consumers of their work. That usually requires a good education (not necessarily in elite institutions) and a thirst for knowledge. Those who are (pure) academics are rarely rich. Many infkuential scientists, artists, writers, and academics fall in that category. I put myself in that category.
2. They can have power because they run large organizations in business or government. They often get to that point because they are judged to be good at what they do by their peers and mentors. Sometimes, they get to such positions through democratic elections. Those who work in government are rarely rich. Kamala Harris falls in that category.
3. They can have power and influence because of their money. If they made their money by creating new and unique things that people like to pay for, fine. Most tech entrepreneurs fall in that category, including Elon, Mark Z, Jensen Huang, etc.
4. They can have power and influence because of money they inherited or obtained through sheer luck. Having by-passed the vetting of their peers, their influence through money may exceed their intellectual legitimacy. In that category are heirs or rich dynasties (Koch, Walton, etc), or accidental co-founders of tech companies who fell victim to Sudden Wealth Syndrome and ""retired"" too early to learn about life.
5. They can have power and influence because of money obtained through unethical activity or outright fraud, perhaps seeded through an inheritance. They often overplay their influence (e.g. though political patronage) because they need to defend their position against the justice system and other enemies. Trump falls in that category.

Categories 1 and 2 are the good elites. They got there because of their skills and personal qualities. They were vetted by mentors, peers, consumers, or voters.
Category 3 can be good or bad elites. They are good if they use their wealth for philanthropy (e.g. in health, science, education, human rights,...). Examples include Bill Gates and Mark Z. They become bad if they use their wealth for excessive self-serving political influence, e.g. by buying and using a propaganda machine. Elon is a perfect example.
Categories 4 and 5 have not been vetted. They may have no skills, no morals, and atrocious personal qualities such as narcissism, grandiosity, dishonesty... Their power and influence are undeserved and can be destructive and dangerous. They often have nothing better to do than overplay their influence. That's Trump.",1675,164,477

2024-08-29 19:04:47+00:00,"The availability of open source frontier models such as Meta's Llama-3.1 is bringing down the cost of *every* model, open or proprietary.",1096,93,31
2024-08-29 16:13:06+00:00,"After a recent price reduction by OpenAI, GPT-4o tokens now cost $4 per million tokens (using a blended rate that assumes 80% input and 20% output tokens). GPT-4 cost $36 per million tokens at its initial release in March 2023. This price reduction over 17 months corresponds to about a 79% drop in price per year. (4/36 = (1 - p)^{17/12}) 

As you can see, token prices are falling rapidly! One force that‚Äôs driving prices down is the release of open weights models such as Llama 3.1. If API providers, including startups Anyscale, Fireworks, Together AI, and some large cloud companies, do not have to worry about recouping the cost of developing a model, they can compete directly on price and a few other factors such as speed. 

Further, hardware innovations by companies such as Groq (a leading player in fast token generation), Samba Nova (which serves Llama 3.1 405B tokens at an impressive 114 tokens per second), and wafer-scale computation startup Cerebras (which just announced a new offering this week), as well as the semiconductor giants NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will drive further price cuts. 

When building applications, I find it useful to design to where the technology is going rather than only where it has been. Based on the technology roadmaps of multiple software and hardware companies ‚Äî which include improved semiconductors, smaller models, and algorithmic innovation in inference architectures ‚Äî I‚Äôm confident that token prices will continue to fall rapidly.

This means that even if you build an agentic workload that isn‚Äôt entirely economical, falling token prices might make it economical at some point. As I wrote previously, being able to process many tokens is particularly important for agentic workloads, which must call a model many times before generating a result. Further, even agentic workloads are already quite affordable for many applications. Let's say you build an application to assist a human worker, and it uses 100 tokens per second continuously: At $4/million tokens, you'd be spending only $1.44/hour ‚Äì which is significantly lower than the minimum wage in the U.S. and many other countries.

So how can AI companies prepare?
- First, I continue to hear from teams that are surprised to find out how cheap LLM usage is when they actually work through cost calculations. For many applications, it isn‚Äôt worth too much effort to optimize the cost. So first and foremost, I advise teams to focus on building a useful application rather than on optimizing LLM costs.
- Second, even if an application is marginally too expensive to run today, it may be worth deploying in anticipation of lower prices.
- Finally, as new models get released, it might be worthwhile to periodically examine an application to decide whether to switch to a new model either from the same provider (such as switching from GPT-4 to the latest GPT-4o-2024-08-06) or a different provider, to take advantage of falling prices and/or increased capabilities.

Because multiple providers now host Llama 3.1 and other open-weight models, if you use one of these models, it might be possible to switch between providers without too much testing (though implementation details ‚Äî specifically quantization, does mean that different offerings of the model do differ in performance). When switching between models, unfortunately, a major barrier is still the difficulty of implementing evals, so carrying out regression testing to make sure your application will still perform after you swap in a new model can be challenging. However, as the science of carrying out evals improves, I‚Äôm optimistic that this will become easier.
